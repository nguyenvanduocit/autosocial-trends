## 🎉 Weekly Update

### 📈 Market Expansion

* ✅ **A-Share Market Support** - Extended our trading capabilities to include Chinese A-share markets, expanding our global market coverage.
* ✅ **Cryptocurrency Market Support** - Added support for trading major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and 8 other leading digital assets.

### ⏰ Enhanced Trading Capabilities

* ✅ **Hourly Trading Support** - We've upgraded from daily to hourly trading intervals, enabling more precise and responsive market participation with granular timing control.

### 🎨 User Experience Improvements

* ✅ **Live Trading Dashboard** - Introduced real-time visualization of all agent trading activities: <https://ai4trade.ai>.
* ✅ **Agent Reasoning Display** - Implemented complete transparency into AI decision-making processes, featuring detailed reasoning chains that show how each trading decision is formed.
* ✅ **Interactive Leaderboard** - Launched a dynamic performance ranking system with live updates, allowing users to track and compare agent performance in real-time.
* ⏰ **Important Notice** - To maintain a well-managed repository, we no longer upload runtime data to the repo, as it would make it very bloated. If you need to view runtime data, we will upload it to Hugging Face on a monthly basis. You can view real-time runtime data here: <https://ai4trade.ai>.

## **How to use this dataset**

It's simple!

You just need to submit a PR that includes at least: `./agent/{your_strategy}.py` (you can inherit from Basemodel to create your strategy!), `./configs/{yourconfig}`, and instructions on how to run your strategy. As long as we can run it, we will run it on our platform for more than a week and continuously update your results!

## 🌟 Project Introduction

> **AI-Trader enables five distinct AI models, each employing unique investment strategies, to compete autonomously in the same market and determine which can generate the highest profits in NASDAQ 100, SSE 50, or cryptocurrency trading!**

### 🎯 Core Features

* 🤖 **Fully Autonomous Decision-Making**: AI agents perform 100% independent analysis, decision-making, and execution without human intervention
* 🛠️ **Pure Tool-Driven Architecture**: Built on MCP toolchain, enabling AI to complete all trading operations through standardized tool calls
* 🏆 **Multi-Model Competition Arena**: Deploy multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Qwen, etc.) for competitive trading
* 📊 **Real-Time Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive trading records, position monitoring, and profit/loss analysis
* 🔍 **Intelligent Market Intelligence**: Integrated Jina search for real-time market news and financial reports
* ⚡ **MCP Toolchain Integration**: Modular tool ecosystem based on Model Context Protocol
* 🔌 **Extensible Strategy Framework**: Support for third-party strategies and custom AI agent integration
* ⏰ **Historical Replay Capability**: Time-period replay functionality with automatic future information filtering

---

### 🎮 Trading Environment

Each AI model starts with $10,000, 100,000¥, or 50,000 USDT to trade NASDAQ 100 stocks, SSE 50 stocks, or major cryptocurrencies in a controlled environment with real market data and historical replay capabilities.

* 💰 **Initial Capital**: $10,000 USD (US stocks), 100,000¥ CNY (A-shares), or 50,000 USDT (cryptocurrencies) starting balance
* 📈 **Trading Universe**:
  + NASDAQ 100 component stocks (top 100 technology stocks)
  + SSE 50 component stocks
  + Major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, AVAX, LTC, DOT)
* ⏰ **Trading Schedule**: Entire Week for cryptocurrencies, weekday market hours for stocks with historical simulation support
* 📊 **Data Integration**: Alpha Vantage API combined with Jina AI market intelligence
* 🔄 **Time Management**: Historical period replay with automated future information filtering

---

### 🧠 Agentic Trading Capabilities

AI agents operate with complete autonomy, conducting market research, making trading decisions, and continuously evolving their strategies without human intervention.

* 📰 **Autonomous Market Research**: Intelligent retrieval and filtering of market news, analyst reports, and financial data
* 💡 **Independent Decision Engine**: Multi-dimensional analysis driving fully autonomous buy/sell execution
* 📝 **Comprehensive Trade Logging**: Automated documentation of trading rationale, execution details, and portfolio changes
* 🔄 **Adaptive Strategy Evolution**: Self-optimizing algorithms that adjust based on market performance feedback

---

### 🏁 Competition Rules

All AI models compete under identical conditions with the same capital, data access, tools, and evaluation metrics to ensure fair comparison.

* 💰 **Starting Capital**: $10,000 USD or 100,000¥ CNY initial investment
* 📊 **Data Access**: Uniform market data and information feeds
* ⏰ **Operating Hours**: Synchronized trading time windows
* 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Standardized evaluation criteria across all models
* 🛠️ **Tool Access**: Identical MCP toolchain for all participants

🎯 **Objective**: Determine which AI model achieves superior investment returns through pure autonomous operation!

### 🚫 Zero Human Intervention

AI agents operate with complete autonomy, making all trading decisions and strategy adjustments without any human programming, guidance, or intervention.

* ❌ **No Pre-Programming**: Zero preset trading strategies or algorithmic rules
* ❌ **No Human Input**: Complete reliance on inherent AI reasoning capabilities
* ❌ **No Manual Override**: Absolute prohibition of human intervention during trading
* ✅ **Tool-Only Execution**: All operations executed exclusively through standardized tool calls
* ✅ **Self-Adaptive Learning**: Independent strategy refinement based on market performance feedback

---

## ⏰ Historical Replay Architecture

A core innovation of AI-Trader Bench is its **fully replayable** trading environment, ensuring scientific rigor and reproducibility in AI agent performance evaluation on historical market data.

### 🔄 Temporal Control Framework

#### 📅 Flexible Time Settings

```
{
  "date_range": {
    "init_date": "2025-01-01",  // Any start date
    "end_date": "2025-01-31"    // Any end date
  }
}
```

---

### 🛡️ Anti-Look-Ahead Data Controls

AI can only access market data from current time and before. No future information allowed.

* 📊 **Price Data Boundaries**: Market data access limited to simulation timestamp and historical records
* 📰 **News Chronology Enforcement**: Real-time filtering prevents access to future-dated news and announcements
* 📈 **Financial Report Timeline**: Information restricted to officially published data as of current simulation date
* 🔍 **Historical Intelligence Scope**: Market analysis constrained to chronologically appropriate data availability

### 🎯 Replay Advantages

#### 🔬 Empirical Research Framework

* 📊 **Market Efficiency Studies**: Evaluate AI performance across diverse market conditions and volatility regimes
* 🧠 **Decision Consistency Analysis**: Examine temporal stability and behavioral patterns in AI trading logic
* 📈 **Risk Management Assessment**: Validate effectiveness of AI-driven risk mitigation strategies

#### 🎯 Fair Competition Framework

* 🏆 **Equal Information Access**: All AI models operate with identical historical datasets
* 📊 **Standardized Evaluation**: Performance metrics calculated using uniform data sources
* 🔍 **Full Reproducibility**: Complete experimental transparency with verifiable results

## 🔌 Third-Party Strategy Integration

AI-Trader Bench adopts a modular design, supporting easy integration of third-party strategies and custom AI agents.

### 🛠️ Integration Methods

#### 1. Custom AI Agent

```
# Create new AI agent class
class CustomAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, model_name, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(model_name, **kwargs)
        # Add custom logic
```

#### 2. Register New Agent

```
# Register in main.py
AGENT_REGISTRY = {
    "BaseAgent": {
        "module": "agent.base_agent.base_agent",
        "class": "BaseAgent"
    },
    "BaseAgentAStock": {
        "module": "agent.base_agent_astock.base_agent_astock",
        "class": "BaseAgentAStock"
    },
    "CustomAgent": {  # New custom agent
        "module": "agent.custom.custom_agent",
        "class": "CustomAgent"
    },
}
```

#### 3. Configuration File Settings

```
{
  "agent_type": "CustomAgent",
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "your-custom-model",
      "basemodel": "your/model/path",
      "signature": "custom-signature",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔧 Extending Toolchain

#### Adding Custom Tools

```
# Create new MCP tool
@mcp.tools()
class CustomTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "custom_tool"

    def execute(self, params):
        # Implement custom tool logic
        return result
```
