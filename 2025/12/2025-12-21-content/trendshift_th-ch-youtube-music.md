## Download

You can check out the [latest release](https://github.com/pear-devs/pear-desktop/releases/latest) to quickly find the
latest version.

### Arch Linux

Install the [`pear-desktop`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pear-desktop) package from the AUR. For AUR installation instructions, take a look at
this [wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository#Installing_packages).

### macOS

You can install the app using Homebrew (see the [cask definition](https://github.com/pear-devs/pear-desktop-homebrew)):

```
brew install pear-devs/pear-desktop
```

If you install the app manually and get an error "is damaged and can’t be opened." when launching the app, run the following in the Terminal:

```
/usr/bin/xattr -cr /Applications/Pear\ Desktop.app
```

### Windows

You can use the [Scoop package manager](https://scoop.sh) to install the `pear-desktop` package from
the [`extras` bucket](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras).

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/pear-desktop
```

Alternately you can use [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/), Windows 11s
official CLI package manager to install the `pear-devs.pear-desktop` package.

*Note: Microsoft Defender SmartScreen might block the installation since it is from an "unknown publisher". This is also
true for the manual installation when trying to run the executable(.exe) after a manual download here on github (same
file).*

```
winget install pear-devs.pear-desktop
```

#### How to install without a network connection? (in Windows)

* Download the `*.nsis.7z` file for *your device architecture* in [release page](https://github.com/pear-devs/pear-desktop/releases/latest).
  + `x64` for 64-bit Windows
  + `ia32` for 32-bit Windows
  + `arm64` for ARM64 Windows
* Download installer in release page. (`*-Setup.exe`)
* Place them in the **same directory**.
* Run the installer.

## Themes

You can load CSS files to change the look of the application (Options > Visual Tweaks > Themes).

Some predefined themes are available in <https://github.com/kerichdev/themes-for-ytmdesktop-player>.

## Dev

```
git clone https://github.com/pear-devs/pear-desktop
cd pear-desktop
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

## Build your own plugins

Using plugins, you can:

* manipulate the app - the `BrowserWindow` from electron is passed to the plugin handler
* change the front by manipulating the HTML/CSS

### Creating a plugin

Create a folder in `src/plugins/YOUR-PLUGIN-NAME`:

* `index.ts`: the main file of the plugin

```
import style from './style.css?inline'; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic show restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style,
  menu: async ({ getConfig, setConfig }) => {
    // All *Config methods are wrapped Promise<T>
    const config = await getConfig();
    return [
      {
        label: 'menu',
        submenu: [1, 2, 3].map((value) => ({
          label: `value ${value}`,
          type: 'radio',
          checked: config.value === value,
          click() {
            setConfig({ value });
          },
        })),
      },
    ];
  },
  backend: {
    start({ window, ipc }) {
      window.maximize();

      // you can communicate with renderer plugin
      ipc.handle('some-event', () => {
        return 'hello';
      });
    },
    // it fired when config changed
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    // it fired when plugin disabled
    stop(context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  renderer: {
    async start(context) {
      console.log(await context.ipc.invoke('some-event'));
    },
    // Only renderer available hook
    onPlayerApiReady(api, context) {
      // set plugin config easily
      context.setConfig({ myConfig: api.getVolume() });
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    stop(_context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  preload: {
    async start({ getConfig }) {
      const config = await getConfig();
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) {},
    stop(_context) {},
  },
});
```

### Common use cases

* injecting custom CSS: create a `style.css` file in the same folder then:

```
// index.ts
import style from './style.css?inline'; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, pear-desktop will show a restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style
  renderer() {} // define renderer hook
});
```

* If you want to change the HTML:

```
import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic will show the restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  renderer() {
    console.log('hello from renderer');
  } // define renderer hook
});
```

* communicating between the front and back: can be done using the ipcMain module from electron. See `index.ts` file and
  example in `sponsorblock` plugin.
