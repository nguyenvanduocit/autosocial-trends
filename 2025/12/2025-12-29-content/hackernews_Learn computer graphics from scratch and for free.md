### Blog

## For Angry Nerds

We’ve been missing a space where we can talk about topics related to 3D programming—and also broader themes like AI and education that connect to the work we do at Scratchapixel.

### Courses

## Learn Vulkan

This is a new project we’ve started. For now, we’re focusing on offering a course specifically targeted at learning the Vulkan API. Interested? Read more…](https://tally.so/r/wg8RZd)

### Book

## Take Scratchapixel to the Beach

We’re working on a book so you can keep a physical reference for computer graphics—very useful if you're stuck on a desert island with no internet. Read more...](https://tally.so/r/3y8Wv4)
