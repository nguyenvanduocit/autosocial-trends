# Replacing JS with just HTML

by [Aaron T. Grogg](https://aarontgrogg.com) published on Dec 27, 2025

For many years now, JavaScript has been the workhorse of the web. If you wanted to do something that couldn't be done with just HTML and CSS, you could usually find a way to do it with JS.
And that is great! JS has helped push user experiences forward, and honestly helped push HTML and CSS forward!

But as time marches on, and the HTML and CSS methods [gain traction](https://webstatus.dev/?q=%28group%3Ahtml+OR+css%29&sort=name_asc), we need to start replacing the old JS methods that feel so comfy with new methods that require less JS.

***Nothing against JS***, but it has better things to do than setup and manage your accordions or offscreen navigation menus... Plus, JS needs to be downloaded, decompressed, evaluated, processed, and then often consumes memory to monitor and maintain features. If we can *hand-off* any JS functionality to native HTML or CSS, then users can download less stuff, and the remaining JS can pay attention to more important tasks that HTML and CSS can't handle (yet).

Below are a few examples; any you care to add?

## Table of Contents:

* [Accordions / Expanding Content Panels](#accordions-expanding-content-panels)
* [Input with Autofilter Suggestions Dropdown](#input-with-autofilter-suggestions-dropdown)
* [Modals / Popovers](#modals-popovers)
* [Offscreen Nav / Content](#offscreen-nav-content)

## Accordions / Expanding Content Panels

### Description:

The `details` and `summary` HTML elements provide an HTML-only replacement to the typical JS accordion:
![Examples of HTML  element expanding and contracting](accordion-expanding-content.gif)
CopePen: [Accordion / Expanding Content](https://codepen.io/aarontgrogg/pen/GgoOqVX)

### Use cases:

* Hiding/showing content
* Expanding content sections

### Basic implementation:

```
<details>
  <summary>Initially closed, click to open</summary>
  Content is initially hidden, but can be revealed by clicking the summary.
</details>
```

Add an `open` attribute to set the default appearance as "open":

```
<details open>
  <summary>Initially open, click to close</summary>
  Content is initially visible, but can be hidden by clicking the summary.
</details>
```

Use the same `name` attribute on all related `details` (like radio buttons) to restrict only one open panel at a time:

```
<details name="foo" open>
  <summary>Initially open, clicking others will close this</summary>
  Content is initially visible, but can be hidden by clicking the summary; only one panel can be open at a time.
</details>
<details name="foo">
  <summary>Initially closed, clicking will open this, and close others</summary>
  Content is initially hidden, but can be revealed by clicking the summary; only one panel can be open at a time.
</details>
<details name="foo">
  <summary>Initially closed, clicking will open this, and close others</summary>
  Content is initially hidden, but can be revealed by clicking the summary; only one panel can be open at a time.
</details>
```

You can also customize the appearance with CSS and trigger the open/close via JS.

Learn more about the `details` element in the previously-published “[For the Love of <details>](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/23)".

## Input with Autofilter Suggestions Dropdown

### Description:

Combining the HTML `input` and `datalist` elements can create a dropdown of options that autofilters as you type:
![Examples of HTML  and  providing autofilter dropdown](input-with-datalist.gif)
CodePen: [Input with Autofilter Suggestions Dropdown](https://codepen.io/aarontgrogg/pen/yyePPor)

### Use cases:

* Site search
* Product search or filter
* Filter any list of data

### Basic implementation:

```
<label for="browser">Browser</label>
<input type="text"
       list="browsers"
       id="browser" name="browser"
       size="50"
       autocomplete="off" />
<datalist id="browsers">
  <option value="Arc"></option>
  <option value="Brave"></option>
  <option value="Chrome"></option>
  <option value="DuckDuckGo"></option>
  <option value="Firefox"></option>
  <option value="Microsoft Edge"></option>
  <option value="Opera"></option>
  <option value="Safari"></option>
  <option value="Tor"></option>
  <option value="Vivaldi"></option></option>
</datalist>
```

You can also use other input types:

```
<label for="quantity">Quantity</label>
<input type="number"
       list="quantity-options"
       id="quantity" name="quantity" />
<datalist id="quantity-options">
  <option value="1"></option>
  <option value="2"></option>
  <option value="5"></option>
  <option value="10"></option>
  <option value="20"></option>
  <option value="50"></option>
</datalist>

<label for="appointment">Appointment</label>
<input type="time"
       list="appointments"
       id="appointment" name="appointment" />
<datalist id="appointments">
  <option value="12:00"></option>
  <option value="13:00"></option>
  <option value="14:00"></option>
</datalist>
```

Note that, at the time of this writing, Firefox was limited to only textual-based input types, so no `date`, `time`, `range` or `color` for now... :-(

Also note that, at the time of this writing, [there are limitations on mobile, and accessibility concerns](https://htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/5/#the-list-attribute-on-lessinputgreater-elements).

## Modals / Popovers

### Description:

The `popover` and `popovertarget` attributes can replace the traditional JS-driven modal/popover/overlay:
![Examples of HTML  elements opening and closing](modal-popover.gif)
CodePen: [Modal / Popover](https://codepen.io/aarontgrogg/pen/QwyOKNW)

### Use cases:

* Hiding/showing side panels / additional information

### Basic implementation

An `auto` popover (default) can be "light dismissed" (clicking outside of it or hitting the `esc` key). Opening an `auto` automatically closes any other `auto` popovers that were open. Clicking the `button` a second time will close the one it opened.

```
<button popovertarget="pop-auto">
   Toggle Popover
</button>
<dialog popover id="pop-auto">
   I'm an "auto" Popover!
</dialog>
```

A `hint` popover can also be "light dismissed". It does *not* close other `hint` popovers when opened. Clicking the `button` a second time will close the one it opened.

```
<button popovertarget="pop-hint">
   Toggle Popover
</button>
<dialog popover="hint" id="pop-hint">
   I'm a "hint" Popover!
</dialog>
```

Note that, at the time of this writing, Firefox and all iOS varieties do not support `hint` popovers.

A `manual` popover can *not* be "light dismissed". It does *not* close other `manual` popovers when opened. Clicking the `button` a second time will close the one it opened.

```
<button popovertarget="pop-manual">
   Toggle Popover
</button>
<dialog popover="manual" id="pop-manual">
   I'm a "manual" Popover!
</dialog>
```

## Offscreen Nav / Content

### Description:

The above Modal / Popover functionality can also be used to create an offscreen navigation that requires no JS:
![Example of HTML Popover used as an offscreen navigation menu](offscreen-nav.gif)

CodePen: [Offscreen Content](https://codepen.io/aarontgrogg/pen/wBMPMVG)

### Use cases:

* Hiding/showing navigation menus

### Basic implementation:

```
<button popovertarget="menu">
   Toggle Menu
</button>
<nav popover id="menu">
   Nav Content
</nav>
```

```
#menu {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
  translate: -100vw;
}
#menu:popover-open {
  translate: 0;
}
```

I use a `nav` element to give it semantic value, but you can use any HTML element (`div`, `section`, `aside`, etc.).

A `popover` defaults to `position: fixed` per the User Agent Stylesheet, and is simply pushed off screen when closed, and pulled back onscreen when it is open. Note that `margin: 0` is required if you want to override the User Agent center-alignment.

Clicking outside of the above menu closes it. You can force the panel to stay open, requiring a manual/explicit close, by using `popover="manual"`.

You can also add a `backdrop` pseudo element and style it as you wish:

```
#menu::backdrop {
  background: rgb(190 190 190 / 75%);
}
```

## Conclusion

While we all love the power and flexibility JS provides, we should also respect it, and our users, by limiting its use to what it *needs* to do.

There is **so** much more that has changed in recent years, including a ton of options that CSS now covers. If you are now hungry for more, have a look at [my longer article that covers those as well](<https://aarontgrogg.com/blog/2023/05/31/replace-js-with-no-js-or-lo-js-options/>.

Happy reducing!
