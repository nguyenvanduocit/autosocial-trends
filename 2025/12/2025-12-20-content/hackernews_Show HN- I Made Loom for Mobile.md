## Frequently Asked Questions

Can I record native apps?

Demo Scope is specifically designed for mobile web content. If your app has a mobile
web version, you can demo that. For native iOS apps, Apple's built-in screen recording
is your best bet - but you won't get face cam or touch indicators.

What streaming platforms are supported?

Demo Scope supports YouTube Live, Twitch, Facebook Live, and any custom RTMP server.
Just enter your stream key and RTMP URL, and you're live with face cam and touch
indicators.

Is it a subscription?

No! Demo Scope Pro is a one-time purchase. Buy once, use forever. No recurring fees,
no annual renewals. We hate subscriptions too.

What's included in the free version?

Everything! The free version includes all features - face cam, touch indicators,
streaming, customization. The only limits are a 5-minute recording/streaming cap and a
small watermark. Try it out, make sure it works for your use case, then upgrade when
ready.

Can I use recordings commercially?

Absolutely. Once you upgrade to Pro (removing the watermark), your recordings are 100%
yours to use however you want - YouTube, courses, client work, anything.
