# Boléro

I perform Maurice Ravel's [Boléro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bol%C3%A9ro) on a variety of homemade
8-bit instruments.

## Download

* [Linus Akesson - Maurice Ravel - Boléro.mp3](//hd0.linusakesson.net/files/Linus%20Akesson%20-%20Maurice%20Ravel%20-%20Bol%C3%A9ro.mp3) (MP3, 26.2 MB)

## Some stats and details

* 9 hours and 42 minutes of footage
* 52 mixer channels
* 13 neck- and bowties
* 9 different instruments
* 1 crazy automaton
* 0 regrets

This project took me a bit over half a year to finish.

I hope you'll enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it! There are many
little details that I'll let you discover on your own.

It was fun to put my tools and methods to the test with this huge
undertaking. When I started out I had no idea if my mixing and video-editing
process would work at this scale, but it turned out to only need a few tweaks
here and there.

The nine instruments are: The [Qweremin](/qweremin/index.php) (breadbin / regular C64C
/ dark C64C), [Qwertuoso](/software/qwertuoso/index.php)
(breadbin), the [Paulimba](/music/paulimba/index.php), the [Tenor Commodordion](/commodordion/tenor.php), the [Family Bass](/music/family-bass/index.php) (albeit not as a bass
this time), my still unnamed [floppy-drive noise instrument](/music/partita-prelude/index.php) (1541
/ 1541-II), the [C=TAR](/music/glyptodont-live/index.php), the [Chipophone](/chipophone/index.php), and a newcomer: NES timpani.

The timpani sound is based on the famous NES staircase triangle wave. But
there is no register for controlling its volume, and yet we can hear an
envelope with a release phase. To achieve this, I rely on a neat trick that was
used already in Super Mario Bros.: It turns out that the triangle channel is
mixed with the ADPCM sample-playback channel and then fed through a non-linear
resistor network (the output is proportional to ((adpcm + triangle)⁻¹
+ C)⁻¹). Therefore, adding a constant DC offset via the sample channel makes
the triangle more or less compressed.

In nearly every part of this video, what you see is what you hear; the audio
and video were recorded at the same time. But the automaton is different:
Thanks to its 100% repeatable performance I could capture the sound of each
individual section of the hardware, with the microphone up close, and then mix
the parts according to taste and combine them with the visuals from a separate
take.

Fun fact: You can't see it in the video but the automaton is supported by
original C64 boxes:

This is the best and most awesome thing I have seen and heard in years! The hard work you've put in to it along with a masterful performance is mindblowing.

In this day and age of ai generated music you've surpassed excellence by not only bringing the computer as an electric music instrument to life but also delivering art at an unprecedented level.

You, sir Linus Åkesson are a true artist. And I mean that with the deepest of respect as an artist myself. I hope your art will reach around the globe as many times as viraly possible for many years to come.

Thank you Linus for brightening the world with you brilliance and for raising the bar. I wish you all the best of fortunes in life.

This makes me nostalgic for Final Fantasy III for the Super NES.

I was already a fan of your work, but this takes the cake.

Congratulations on another amazing piece!
