# Every Programmer Should Know 🤔

A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

*These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack*

Highly opinionated 💣. Not backed by science.
Comes in no particular order ♻️

### ⭐ it and share with a friendly developer!

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! 💪*

*P.P.S. [Contributions](/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!*
