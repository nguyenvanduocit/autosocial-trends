Garmin has confirmed the first emergency use of its [Autoland](https://avbrief.com/more-garmin-autothrottle-safety-backstop-for-big-king-airs/) system occurred on Saturday in Colorado. “Garmin can confirm that an emergency Autoland activation occurred at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado,” the company said in a statement Sunday. “The Autoland took place on Sat., Dec. 20, resulting in a successful landing. We look forward to sharing additional details at the appropriate time.” Social media posts from flight tracking hobbyists reported a King Air 200 squawked 7700 about 2 p.m. local time today. The Autoland system was initiated and landed the aircraft at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport near Denver. A recording from [LiveATC’s feed](https://www.liveatc.net/archive.php) of the airport’s tower frequency includes a robotic female voice declaring a pilot incapacitation and the intention to land on Runway 30. The tape is below and first mention of the incident by ATC is at about 5:00. The Autoland system announces its intentions at about 11:10. (The time stamps are approximate.) There is no word on the condition of the pilot but social media posts suggest all aboard were safe.

The aircraft, [N479BR](https://www.flightaware.com/live/flight/N479BR/history/20251220/1910Z/KASE/KBJC), was being operated by Buffalo River Outfitters from Aspen to Rocky Mountain Metropolitan. It’s not clear how many people were on board. The system appeared to work flawlessly, and the controller at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan seemed to take it in stride, accommodating as many requests as he could before shutting down the airport for the landing. We’ll have more detail on this as it becomes available.

Larry Anglisano recorded this [video demonstration of the Autoland system](https://avbrief.com/king-air-emergency-autoland-demo/) in the Beechcraft King Air.

A reader was at the airport Saturday and shared this video that he had posted to Instagram.

I caught some video of the King Air right after it stopped on the runway today. See here:

Kudos to Garmin for developing such an amazing system, to Textron Aviation for making it available for some of its models, to the pilot who must have done a thorough preflight briefing and to the passenger(s) who had the presence of mind to press the red button. Also kudos to the air traffic controller who handled the emergency with such cool professionalism. I hope that the pilot is okay.

I might also add, kudos to this company for installing the system in this aircraft. It is no small expense, but their decision saved lives–and an airplane.

Impressive indeed, and kudos to the Denver controllers, that’s some pretty busy time there. Glad everyone is safe, (hopefully that includes the pilot.)

Autoland is not cute tech. The emergency was pilot incapacitation. The system took over, ATC kept the runway and airspace clean, and everyone got down safe. That is exactly what this is for. Impressive.

I’ve seen several demonstrations of the system and it’s nice to see that it operates the same way in the wild. The SR-22T G7+ that I fly has the system and I’m glad it’s there while hoping it’s never used.

I’ve seen posts on VAF from someone at the airport stating the autoland was accidentally activated, and the pilots didn’t know how to deactivate it. There were 2 pilots onboard.

Here’s a summary for deactivization thanks to AI:

To turn off an accidentally activated emergency autoland (like Garmin’s [Autonomi](https://www.google.com/search?q=Autonomi&sca_esv=b0161b4f20500fb0&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS1007US1007&sxsrf=AE3TifNtg-HYJCYNuBexEut9qm8Y4y8MOA%3A1766350749381&ei=nV9IacL-Fo_hwN4P3eXu0AY&ved=2ahUKEwj7i_nzzM-RAxU2L9AFHVnLEYcQgK4QegQIARAB&uact=5&oq=how+is+emergency+autoland+turned+off+if+accidentally+activated&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiPmhvdyBpcyBlbWVyZ2VuY3kgYXV0b2xhbmQgdHVybmVkIG9mZiBpZiBhY2NpZGVudGFsbHkgYWN0aXZhdGVkSMJlUM8MWJZicAJ4AJABAJgBjQGgAekkqgEEMy4zNrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCJ6ACxSXCAg4QABiABBiwAxiGAxiKBcICCxAAGIAEGLADGKIEwgIIEAAYsAMY7wXCAgUQIRigAcICBRAhGKsCwgIEECMYJ8ICCBAAGIAEGKIEmAMAiAYBkAYIkgcEMy4zNqAHmsEBsgcEMS4zNrgHqSXCBwkxLjE1LjIwLjPIB6EBgAgA&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&mstk=AUtExfAdFdRt_YZISgGjsfvAkyl3nbeGnB0sFaLA1EQjq8NGSfNwAPcxTHl9v_NlIKtozMUGvn1WTy3AcRbolXEvDG6JJk__QszX-pKUlPSuIGuPW_WtLWqC_e_f7hgKI2DEwUP9BbxiizuZN6AlMJPxN2vClLkvpWMmKsHKZxcGIuEAA9PyM__Ws8JDmVCiYnNxVoUw7-Tz7WHOnwbUIDvVYfOnHXu0kk1CvBEqZzHy04rSkOq6vFKEcBr1EAZVidvcr5JWWLf4QCR8izotQ0kylvwoG16FdyNPMFsRvrOBmv5aUw&csui=3)), you simply press the **Autopilot (AP) button** on the controller or the **AP disconnect button** on the control yoke (stick). This immediately disengages the system, giving control back to the pilot, with audio/visual confirmation, and allows for re-engagement of normal autopilot or manual flight after checking aircraft settings.
Key Steps for Deactivation:

1. **Press AP Disconnect/AP Button:** A single press of the red autopilot disconnect button on the yoke or the AP button on the mode controller stops the autoland sequence.
2. **Listen for Confirmation:** The system announces “Emergency autoland deactivated”.
3. **Check Aircraft Status:** Review the flight displays for changes (like transponder code 7700, altimeter, flaps, gear) and reset them for normal flight.
4. **Inform ATC:** Contact Air Traffic Control to state you are no longer in an emergency.

Before Full Engagement (15-Second Window):

* For systems like Garmin’s HomeSafe, there’s a 15-second warning before full control takeover.
* During this window, you might need to double-press the AP DISC button (on some models) to cancel before it fully engages.

After Deactivation:

* The autopilot can be re-engaged if desired, but you’ll need to re-enter the flight plan and potentially reconfigure the system.

That observation came from a Reddit post in which someone says he heard the pilot say that to ATC but the Rocky Mountain controller said the King Air was NORDO. He also prefaced his final landing clearance with “If you can hear me….” We’re trying to get confirmation one way or another. Stay tuned.
