###### Hack Mozilla Firefox address bar

In Firefox's address bar, you can limit results by typing special characters before or after your term:

* `^` - for matches in your browsing history
* `*` - for matches in your bookmarks.
* `%` - for matches in your currently open tabs.
* `#` - for matches in page titles.
* `@` - for matches in web addresses.

###### Chrome hidden commands

* `chrome://chrome-urls` - list of all commands
* `chrome://flags` - enable experiments and development features
* `chrome://interstitials` - errors and warnings
* `chrome://net-internals` - network internals (events, dns, cache)
* `chrome://network-errors` - network errors
* `chrome://net-export` - start logging future network activity to a file
* `chrome://safe-browsing` - safe browsing options
* `chrome://user-actions` - record all user actions
* `chrome://restart` - restart chrome
* `chrome://dino` - ERR\_INTERNET\_DISCONNECTED...
* `cache:<website-address>` - view the cached version of the web page

###### Bypass WAFs by Shortening IP Address (by [0xInfection](https://twitter.com/0xInfection))

IP addresses can be shortened by dropping the zeroes:

```
http://1.0.0.1 → http://1.1
http://127.0.0.1 → http://127.1
http://192.168.0.1 → http://192.168.1

http://0xC0A80001 or http://3232235521 → 192.168.0.1
http://192.168.257 → 192.168.1.1
http://192.168.516 → 192.168.2.4
```

> This bypasses WAF filters for SSRF, open-redirect, etc where any IP as input gets blacklisted.

( _ciph="aes128" ; _fd="private.key" ; _fd_pass="private_pass.key" ; \
openssl rsa -${_ciph} -in ${_fd} -out ${_fd_pass}
```

###### Check private key

```
( _fd="private.key" ; \
openssl rsa -check -in ${_fd} )
```

###### Get public key from private key

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_pub="public.key" ; \
openssl rsa -pubout -in ${_fd} -out ${_fd_pub} )
```

###### Generate private key and CSR

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_csr="request.csr" ; _len="2048" ; \
openssl req -out ${_fd_csr} -new -newkey rsa:${_len} -nodes -keyout ${_fd} )
```

###### Generate CSR

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_csr="request.csr" ; \
openssl req -out ${_fd_csr} -new -key ${_fd} )
```

###### Generate CSR (metadata from existing certificate)

> Where `private.key` is the existing private key. As you can see you do not generate this CSR from your certificate (public key). Also you do not generate the "same" CSR, just a new one to request a new certificate.

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_csr="request.csr" ; _fd_crt="cert.crt" ; \
openssl x509 -x509toreq -in ${_fd_crt} -out ${_fd_csr} -signkey ${_fd} )
```

###### Generate CSR with -config param

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_csr="request.csr" ; \
openssl req -new -sha256 -key ${_fd} -out ${_fd_csr} \
-config <(
cat << __EOF__
[req]
default_bits        = 2048
default_md          = sha256

[ dn ]
C   = "<two-letter ISO abbreviation for your country>"

subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = <fully qualified domain name>
DNS.2 = <next domain>
DNS.3 = <next domain>
__EOF__
))
```

Other values in `[ dn ]`:

```
countryName            = "DE"                     # C=
stateOrProvinceName    = "Hessen"                 # ST=

emailAddress           = "webmaster@example.com"  # CN/emailAddress=
```

Example of `oids` (you'll probably also have to make OpenSSL know about the new fields required for EV by adding the following under `[new_oids]`):

```
[req]
...
oid_section         = new_oids

[ new_oids ]
postalCode = 2.5.4.17
streetAddress = 2.5.4.9
```

Full example:

```
( _fd="private.key" ; _fd_csr="request.csr" ; \
openssl req -new -sha256 -key ${_fd} -out ${_fd_csr} \
-config <(
cat << __EOF__

#### Shell Tricks  [[TOC]](#anger-table-of-contents)

When you get a shell, it is generally not very clean, but after following these steps, you will have a fairly clean and comfortable shell to work with.

1. `script /dev/null -c bash`
2. Ctrl-Z (to send it to background)
3. `stty raw -echo; fg` (returns the shell to foreground)
4. `reset` (to reset terminal)
5. `xterm` (when asked for terminal type)
6. `export TERM=xterm; export SHELL=bash`

#### Shell functions  [[TOC]](#anger-table-of-contents)

##### Table of Contents

* [Domain resolve](#domain-resolve)
* [Get ASN](#get-asn)

###### Domain resolve

```
# Dependencies:
#   - curl
#   - jq

function DomainResolve() {

  local _host="$1"

  local _curl_base="curl --request GET"
  local _timeout="15"

  _host_ip=$($_curl_base -ks -m "$_timeout" "https://dns.google.com/resolve?name=${_host}&type=A" | \
  jq '.Answer[0].data' | tr -d "\"" 2>/dev/null)

  if [[ -z "$_host_ip" ]] || [[ "$_host_ip" == "null" ]] ; then

    echo -en "Unsuccessful domain name resolution.\\n"

  else

    echo -en "$_host > $_host_ip\\n"

  fi

}
```

Example:

```
shell> DomainResolve nmap.org
nmap.org > 45.33.49.119

shell> DomainResolve nmap.org
Unsuccessful domain name resolution.
```

###### Get ASN

```
# Dependencies:
#   - curl

function GetASN() {

  local _ip="$1"

  local _curl_base="curl --request GET"
  local _timeout="15"

  _asn=$($_curl_base -ks -m "$_timeout" "http://ip-api.com/line/${_ip}?fields=as")

  _state=$(echo $?)

  if [[ -z "$_ip" ]] || [[ "$_ip" == "null" ]] || [[ "$_state" -ne 0 ]]; then

    echo -en "Unsuccessful ASN gathering.\\n"

  else

    echo -en "$_ip > $_asn\\n"

  fi

}
```

Example:

```
shell> GetASN 1.1.1.1
1.1.1.1 > AS13335 Cloudflare, Inc.

shell> GetASN 0.0.0.0
Unsuccessful ASN gathering.
```
