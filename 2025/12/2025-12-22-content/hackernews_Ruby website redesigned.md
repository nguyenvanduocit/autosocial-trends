## Why Ruby?

Why do programmers around the world love Ruby? What makes it **fun**?

### Ecosystem

![](/images/home/why_ruby/line.svg)

Rich gems support all kinds of development.
Mature tooling ready to use.

Ruby has a vast collection of libraries called gems, supporting everything from web development to data processing.
With mature frameworks like Rails and comprehensive toolchains, you can combine excellent existing resources
to build high-quality applications quickly without reinventing the wheel.

“

When I released Ruby to the world, I never imagined such a rich ecosystem would grow from it.
Over 200,000 gems, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Bundler—it was the community that created and nurtured all of these.
My wish to "make programmers happy" has been realized in ways I could never have achieved alone.

Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto

Creator of Ruby

### Simple

![](/images/home/why_ruby/line.svg)

Easy to write, easy to read.
Natural syntax like spoken language.

Ruby has a simple and intuitive syntax that reads like natural language.
By eliminating complex symbols and verbose constructs, Ruby's design philosophy allows you to express what you want directly.
With minimal boilerplate and high readability, it's friendly to beginners and maintainable for experienced developers.

“

Ruby is just the most beautiful programming language I have ever seen.
And I pay a fair amount of attention to new programming languages that are coming up,
new environments, new frameworks, and I've still yet to see anything that meets or beats Ruby in its pureness of its design.

David Heinemeier Hansson

Creator of Ruby on Rails

### Productivity

![](/images/home/why_ruby/line.svg)

Do more with less code.
Intuitive syntax accelerates development.

Ruby's expressive syntax allows you to write complex logic concisely.
By leveraging powerful features like metaprogramming and blocks, you can reduce repetition and focus on solving core problems.
With rich testing frameworks, you can maintain quality while achieving rapid development cycles.

“

Ruby turns ideas into code fast.
Its simplicity keeps me focused; its expressiveness lets me write the way I think.
It feels like the language gets out of the way, leaving just me and the problem.
With great tools and libraries, ideas quickly become running, elegant, code.

Dave Thomas

Author of "The Pragmatic Programmer"

### Community

![](/images/home/why_ruby/line.svg)

Developers worldwide support each other.
A warm, active community.

The Ruby community embraces the culture of "Matz is nice and so we are nice (MINASWAN),"
welcoming everyone from beginners to experts. Conferences and meetups around the world foster knowledge sharing and connections.
It's a warm, sustainable community where people help each other and grow together.

“

The Ruby community is filled with talent and creativity, developers attracted to Ruby's elegant syntax who program for the joy of it.
It's a vibrant, welcoming community willing to share this love of programming with everyone.
This spirit of warmth and collaboration is hands down Ruby's greatest asset.

Amanda Perino

Executive Director of Rails Foundation
