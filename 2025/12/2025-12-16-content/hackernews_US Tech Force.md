# Tech for the American People.

## US Tech Force

The US Tech Force is recruiting an elite corps of engineers to build the next generation of government technology. Backed by the White House, Tech Force will tackle the most complex and large-scale civic and defense challenges of our era – from administering critical financial infrastructure at the Treasury Department to advancing cutting-edge programs at the Department of Defense – and everything in between.

Through a two-year program, participants will work in teams reporting directly to agency leadership. In collaboration with leading technology companies, participants will receive technical training, engage with industry leaders, and work closely with senior managers from companies partnering with the Tech Force.

Upon completing the program, engineers can seek employment with the partnering private-sector companies for potential full-time roles – demonstrating the value of combining civil service with technical expertise.

If you are highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management and want to build the future of American government technology, join the Tech Force today.
