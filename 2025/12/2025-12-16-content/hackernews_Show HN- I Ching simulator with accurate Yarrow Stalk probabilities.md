## Methods of Consultation

### Three Coins Method

The 3 coin method is the most popular way to get an I Ching reading. Each toss creates a line based on the probability of heads (Yang) and tails (Yin). Quick and accessible, perfect for beginners and daily consultations.

### Yarrow Stalk Method

The traditional yarrow stalk method uses 50 sticks and offers a slower, meditative path to divination. This ancient approach provides a different probability distribution and deeper ritual experience.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Is online I Ching reading as accurate as in-person?

Yes. The core of the I Ching is synchronicity, as described by psychologist Carl Jung. Your intention and the moment of consultation matter more than the physical tool. Whether using virtual coins or physical yarrow stalks, the oracle responds to your sincere inquiry.

Which method is better: I Ching Coins or Yarrow Stalks?

While the Yarrow Stalk method is the traditional approach offering a slower, meditative experience, I Ching coins are far more convenient for daily practice. The Three Coins method is faster, easier to learn, and equally valid for divination. Most modern practitioners prefer coins for their accessibility.

What are Moving Lines and how do I interpret them?

Moving lines (also called changing lines) are lines in your hexagram that are in a state of transformation. They represent dynamic aspects of your situation. When you have moving lines, your hexagram transforms into a second hexagram, showing the potential evolution of your circumstances.

How should I phrase my question for an I Ching reading?

Open-ended questions work best. Instead of asking 'Should I take this job?' try 'What should I understand about this job opportunity?' The I Ching provides wisdom for reflection rather than simple yes/no answers. Focus on your genuine concern and approach with sincerity.

Do I need to sign up to use this tool?

No sign-up is required. Our I Ching divination tool is completely free and can be used immediately. Simply enter your question and choose your preferred divination method to begin your consultation.

How does the AI interpretation feature work?

After your hexagram is cast, you can optionally request an AI-powered interpretation that considers your specific question, the hexagram meanings, and any moving lines. The AI provides personalized guidance while respecting the traditional wisdom of the I Ching.

What is a hexagram and how many are there?

A hexagram is a figure composed of six horizontal lines, each either solid (Yang) or broken (Yin). There are 64 hexagrams in the I Ching, each representing a unique archetype of change and providing specific wisdom for different life situations.

Can I use this I Ching tool on mobile devices?

Yes, our virtual I Ching reading tool is fully responsive and works on all devices including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The interface adapts to provide an optimal experience on any screen size.
