# Learn about updates to dark web report

We are discontinuing the dark web report, which was meant to scan the dark web for your personal information. The key dates are:

* **January 15, 2026:** The scans for new dark web breaches stop.
* **February 16, 2026:** The dark web report is no longer available.

## Understand why dark web report is discontinued

While the report offered general information, feedback showed that it didn't provide helpful next steps. We're making this change to instead focus on tools that give you more clear, actionable steps to protect your information online. We'll continue to track and defend you from online threats, including the dark web, and build tools that help protect you and your personal information.

We encourage you to use the existing tools we offer to strengthen your security and privacy, including:

* [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)
* [Create a Passkey to Log Into Your Google Account](https://www.google.com/account/about/passkeys/)
* [Authentication Tools for secure Sign-In Google Safety Center](https://safety.google/safety/authentication/)
* [Google Password Manager](https://passwords.google.com/)
* [Password Checkup](https://passwords.google.com/checkup/start)

We encourage you to also use [Results about you](https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you). This tool helps you find and request the removal of your personal information from Google Search results, like your phone number and home address.

## Understand what happens to your monitoring profile data

On February 16, 2026, all data related to dark web report will be deleted. You can also delete your data ahead of time. After you delete your profile, you'll no longer have access to dark web report.

### Delete your monitoring profile

1. On your computer, go to the [Dark web report](https://myactivity.google.com/dark-web-report).
2. Under “Results with your info,” click **Edit monitoring profile**.
3. At the bottom, click **Delete monitoring profile** ![and then](//lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_l97rr0GvhSP2XV5OoCkV2ZDTIisAOczrSdzNCBxhIKWrjXjHucxNwocghoUa39gw=h36) Delete ![](//storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/qN8aOaZwONaYOi3lr5FPJ1PBnQFXqAbpvQLE).

**Tip:** To be eligible for dark web report, you must have a consumer Google Account. [Google Workspace accounts](/accounts/answer/6250166) and [supervised accounts](/families/answer/9055704) aren't able to use dark web report.
