### Work in a local, WYSIWYG, markdown editor powered by Claude Code

![Nimbalyst Hero Files Dev Dark- Social-1](https://47971911.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/47971911/hubfs/Nimbalyst%20Hero%20Files%20Dev%20Dark-%20Social-1.png?width=2000&height=1119&name=Nimbalyst%20Hero%20Files%20Dev%20Dark-%20Social-1.png "Nimbalyst Hero Files Dev Dark- Social-1")

Don't limp along in an IDE wasn't built for words and diagrams. Stop switching between your markdown editor and the command line.

### Iterate with AI on html mockups. Annotate, edit, embed, & use to code.

Use all your context (docs, sessions, code) to build your mockups with Claude Code. And vice versa. No copy/paste needed.

### Manage agents' work across parallel Claude Code sessions

Tie sessions to documents to sessions, find and resume sessions, treat sessions as context, code, review, commit.

### Build your data model with AI based on your code and docs. Use it to write better code.

![Data Model Dark](https://47971911.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hub/47971911/hubfs/Data%20Model%20Dark.png?width=2000&height=1257&name=Data%20Model%20Dark.png "Data Model Dark")

Integrate your context. Work in one UI with all your files local and in git.
