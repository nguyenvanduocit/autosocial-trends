Why?

I find that the drag and drop experience can quickly become a
nightmare, especially on mobile.

Trying to tap, hold, drag, and scroll, all at the same time, is
awkward, slow, and error-prone.

I've long had in mind a simpler 2-step approach: picking an item
first, then placing it.

So I implemented this basic version to showcase my idea.

How does this work?

When picking an item, a duplicate of the list is created on top of
the original one.

The duplicate is interactive and animated, and will update based on
the scroll position.

At the end, the user can either confirm or cancel the changes.

Is this a library?

Not exactly. This is merely a proof of concept, to convey what I had
in mind.

You can however look at the
