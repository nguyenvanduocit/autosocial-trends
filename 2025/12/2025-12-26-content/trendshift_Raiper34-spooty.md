# Spooty - selfhosted Spotify downloader

Spooty is a self-hosted Spotify downloader.
It allows download track/playlist/album from the Spotify url.
It can also subscribe to a playlist or author page and download new songs upon release.
Spooty basically downloads nothing from Spotify, it only gets information from spotify and then finds relevant and downloadeds music on Youtube.
The project is based on NestJS and Angular.

Important

Please do not use this tool for piracy! Download only music you own rights! Use this tool only on your responsibility.

  raiper34/spooty:latest
```

#### Docker compose

```
services:
  spooty:
    image: raiper34/spooty:latest
    container_name: spooty
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:

    environment:
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
      # Configure other environment variables if needed

* add your Spotify application credentials to the `.env` file:

  ```
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
  SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
  ```
