### [Compatibility with C is Key for Memory Safe Software](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/compatibility-with-c/)

We're in the beginning phases of a journey towards memory safety for the Internet's critical software infrastructure, and as we get going it makes the most sense to break down big problems into smaller ones by focusing on replacing components within existing C and C++ software.
