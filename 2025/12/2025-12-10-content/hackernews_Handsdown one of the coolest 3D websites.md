Behind the scene

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

If you are curious about the stack and how I built it, here’s everything you need to know.

## Three.js

[Three.js](https://threejs.org) is the library I’m using to render this 3D world.

It was created by **mr.doob** ([X](https://x.com/mrdoob), [GitHub](http://github.com/mrdoob)), followed by hundreds of awesome developers, one of which being Sunag ([X](https://x.com/sea3dformat), [GitHub](https://github.com/sunag)) who added [TSL](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language), enabling the use of both WebGL and WebGPU, making this portfolio possible.

## Three.js Journey

If you want to learn Three.js, I got you covered with this [huge course](https://threejs-journey.com).

It contains everything you need to start building awesome stuff with Three.js (and much more).

## Devlogs

I’ve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/%40BrunoSimon).

Even though the portfolio is out, I’m still working on the last videos so that the series is complete.

## Code source

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/brunosimon/folio-2025) under [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Even the Blender files are there, so have fun!

For security reasons, I’m not sharing the server code, but the portfolio works without it.

## Musics

The music you hear was made especially for this portfolio by the awesome Kounine ([Linktree](https://linktr.ee/Kounine)).

They are now under [CC0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/), meaning you can do whatever you want with them!

Download them [here](https://github.com/brunosimon/folio-2025/tree/main/static/sounds/musics).
