# Claude Quickstarts

Claude Quickstarts is a collection of projects designed to help developers quickly get started with building applications using the Claude API. Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To use these quickstarts, you'll need an Claude API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

## Available Quickstarts

### Customer Support Agent

A customer support agent powered by Claude. This project demonstrates how to leverage Claude's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to create an AI-assisted customer support system with access to a knowledge base.

[Go to Customer Support Agent Quickstart](/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/blob/main/customer-support-agent)

### Financial Data Analyst

A financial data analyst powered by Claude. This project demonstrates how to leverage Claude's capabilities with interactive data visualization to analyze financial data via chat.

[Go to Financial Data Analyst Quickstart](/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/blob/main/financial-data-analyst)

### Computer Use Demo

An environment and tools that Claude can use to control a desktop computer. This project demonstrates how to leverage the computer use capabilities of Claude, including support for the latest `computer_use_20251124` tool version with zoom actions.

[Go to Computer Use Demo Quickstart](/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/blob/main/computer-use-demo)

### Autonomous Coding Agent

An autonomous coding agent powered by the Claude Agent SDK. This project demonstrates a two-agent pattern (initializer + coding agent) that can build complete applications over multiple sessions, with progress persisted via git and a feature list that the agent works through incrementally.

[Go to Autonomous Coding Agent Quickstart](/anthropics/claude-quickstarts/blob/main/autonomous-coding)

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the specific quickstart directory
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Set up your Claude API key as an environment variable
5. Run the quickstart application
