# Welcome!

```
|- Welcome to Nova! -|
    ~ Nova is a lightweight language for... ~
        . sketching out ideas,
        . documents, notes and personal tools,
        . casual modeling and thinking,
        . computing without computers
```

If you've ever wanted to make a computer come to life through programming, you probably know how complicated it can be. Intricate incantations, confusing instructions, and large, complicated tools can make approaching programming incredibly difficult.

To address this, we've built something we call Nova. It is a programming language, a note-taking system, a way of sketching, and a way of conversing with programmers and machines!

We invite you to investigate what we've discovered and try it for yourself!
