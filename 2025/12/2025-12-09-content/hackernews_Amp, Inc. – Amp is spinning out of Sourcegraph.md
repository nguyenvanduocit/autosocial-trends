# Amp, Inc.

Amp is becoming a separate company. We're spinning out of Sourcegraph to become an independent research lab.

Our goal: let software builders harness the full power of artificial intelligence.

We believe the way we develop software will change. All of it will change, fundamentally and drastically. Nobody knows exactly how. We intend to find out.

We believe that shipping is the best way to do that. We don't want to write papers about the future; we want to put it in your hands.

Amp Inc. gives us more freedom to do that, to focus ruthlessly on the frontier, to explore the absurd and find the possible.

Amp's traction spun us out of Sourcegraph. Amp is profitable. Now, as our own company, we can follow where it leads.

Come with us. Let's see what's possible.
