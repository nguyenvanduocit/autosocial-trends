## Welcome to Legacy Update

## Microsoft Download Center Archive

Welcome to Legacy Update’s archive of the Microsoft Download Center.

Over the years, Microsoft has deleted thousands of downloads for prior versions of Windows, Office, Visual Studio, SQL Server, and more. These downloads include ones for Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, and 7, old versions of runtimes such as the .NET Framework, Visual C++ Redistributable, and DirectX, and freeware tools such as Microsoft Virtual PC and Microsoft SQL Server, among countless other Microsoft no longer supports.

Legacy Update has catalogued the Microsoft Download Center between 2012 and 2024. You can browse the archive below, or use the search box to find a specific download.

Deleted downloads are no longer supported by Microsoft, and may have known security vulnerabilities. After installing, check for updates using [Legacy Update](/).

| ![](/windowsupdate/v6/shared/images/info_16x.gif?b61cd352) | Archive Update We are expanding our Microsoft Download Center archive with content deleted between 2012 and 2025. This adds many previously popular downloads such as Office Viewers, Windows Defender for Windows XP, various updates for Windows 98, Me, and NT 4.0, Office 97 and 2000, and so on.  We’re still working through tidying up irregularities in the data. Let us know on [Discord](https://legacyupdate.net/discord) or [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/LegacyUpdate/discussions) if you find any issues. |

![Archive Team](/assets/archiveteam.png?c2b45a5f)

This archive could not be as comprehensive without the incredible work done by [Archive Team](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Microsoft_Download_Center), who sprung into action when Microsoft rudely announced the removal of thousands of legacy downloads with only a few days’ notice, through an [obscure forum post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/sha-1-windows-content-to-be-retired-august-3-2020/ba-p/1544373). The reason many of the downloads have been archived at all is because of their [The Microsoft Download Center Takedown](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_microsoft_download) project.

Downloads are provided through the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)’s incredible [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) project. Without Internet Archive’s archival bots continuously humming along in the background, making backups of anything and everything they can find, insane amounts of our recent online history would be lost forever.

You can help Archive Team in their mission! [Visit their website](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/) for more info.

A huge thank you also goes to:

* The [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/item/lcwaN0015532/)’s web archival project, which filled in some gaps in the Wayback Machine’s archives
* [fullpwnmedia](https://fullpwn.net/), for helping out with some of the archival efforts
