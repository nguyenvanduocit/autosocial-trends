## Frequently asked questions

### What are GitHub's limits?

GitHub has generous limits for Issues API. Free accounts get 5,000 requests per hour and unlimited Issues creation. For most websites, this means thousands of form submissions per month at no cost. Storage is unlimited - your contact data lives in Issues forever.

### Will I hit the rate limit?

Unlikely. 5,000 requests/hour means you can handle ~120,000 submissions per day. For context, most landing pages get 10-100 submissions per month. Even viral campaigns stay well within limits.

### How do email notifications work?

GitHub automatically emails you when a new Issue is created. No configuration needed. You can customize notification settings in your GitHub account - choose instant emails, daily digests, or disable them.

### Is this GDPR compliant?

Yes. You control the data since it's stored in your own GitHub repository. Add a privacy policy explaining where contact data is stored. You can delete Issues anytime, and users can request deletion under GDPR.

### Can I use this for production sites?

Absolutely. GitForms uses GitHub's stable API with 99.9% uptime. Thousands of sites use GitHub Issues for production workflows. It's more reliable than many paid form services.

### What if GitHub changes their API?

GitHub maintains backward compatibility and announces changes months in advance. Since you own the code, you can adapt quickly. The Issues API has been stable for over 10 years.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, anytime. Use GitHub's API to export all Issues as JSON, CSV, or any format. You can also migrate to a different system - no vendor lock-in.

### Do I need technical knowledge?

Basic knowledge helps but isn't required. If you can deploy to Vercel and create a GitHub token, you can use GitForms. Setup takes 5 minutes with our step-by-step guide.

### Is this the intended use of GitHub Issues?

Honestly, no. GitForms uses GitHub Issues creatively as storage. While technically compliant with API terms, it's best suited for personal projects and prototypes (10-100 submissions/month). For high-traffic commercial sites, consider traditional databases like Supabase or Airtable.
