* Tip: For help building, look at the GitHub Actions file!

## Building at a glance (Linux)

To download the latest stable release, get the latest version tag from the [latest releases page](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop/releases/latest) and append the following to your pull command during the build phase for JMP "--branch $VERSIONTAG --single-branch"

Example:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop.git --branch v1.9.1 --single-branch
```

cd jellyfin-desktop

```

### Fedora based systems

Install dependencies:

```
sudo dnf install autoconf automake libtool freetype-devel libXrandr-devel libvdpau-devel libva-devel  mesa-libGL-devel libdrm-devel libX11-devel  mesa-libEGL-devel yasm  alsa-lib pulseaudio-libs-devel zlib-devel fribidi-devel git gnutls-devel mesa-libGLU-devel  SDL2-devel cmake wget g++ qt-devel libcec-devel qt6-qtbase-devel curl unzip qt6-qtwebchannel-devel qt6-qtwebengine-devel mpv.x86_64 qt6-qtbase.x86_64 meson.noarch ninja-build.x86_64 qt6-qtbase-private-devel mpv-libs.x86_64 mpv-devel qt6-qtdeclarative nasm libatomic libshaderc mpvqt-devel
```

Build commands for Fedora:

Note, the only real differences here is that libraries are in diffrent directories on Fedora systems.

```
mkdir ~/jmp; cd ~/jmp
git clone https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build.git
cd mpv-build/
echo -Dlibmpv=true > mpv_options
echo -Dpipewire=disabled >> mpv_options # hopefully temporary
./rebuild -j`nproc`
sudo ./install
sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libmpv.so /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.1
sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib64/libmpv.so /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so
sudo ldconfig
cd ~/jmp/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop.git
cd jellyfin-desktop/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/ ..
make -j`nproc`
sudo make install
```

## Building for Windows

Please install:

* [cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) - cmake-3.20.0-windows-x86\_64.msi
  + Add cmake to the path.
* [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases)
  + Place this in the build directory.
* [QT](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you?hsLang=en)
  + This package is huge. You also need to make a QT account...
  + Check "MSVC 2019 64-bit" and "Qt WebEngine" under Qt 6.
* [VS2019 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)
  + Again this will use a lot of disk space. The installer is small though.
* [libmpv1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/libmpv/)
  + Place the contents in the build directory, in a subfolder called `mpv`.
  + Move the contents of the `include` folder to an `mpv` folder inside the `include` folder.
  + Move the `mpv-1.dll` to `mpv.dll`.
* [WIX](https://wixtoolset.org/releases/v3.11.2/stable)

You need to run these commands in git bash.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop
cd jellyfin-desktop
mkdir build
cd build
```

Open the "x86\_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019". `cd` to the `build` directory. Run:

```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.11\bin
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja.exe -DQTROOT=C:/Qt/6.x.x/msvc2019_64 -DMPV_INCLUDE_DIR=mpv/include -DMPV_LIBRARY=mpv/libmpv-2.dll -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=output ..
lib /def:mpv\mpv.def /out:mpv\mpv.dll.lib /MACHINE:X64
ninja
ninja windows_package
```

## Building for MacOS

Install [Qt 6](https://www.qt.io/download-thank-you?hsLang=en), remember to check `Qt WebEngine`.

Then run the following commands (replace <QT\_DIR> with your QT installation location):

```
brew install mpv ninja qt

git clone --recursive https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop.git
cd jellyfin-desktop

cmake -B build -G Ninja -DUSE_STATIC_MPVQT=ON
cmake --build build
```

## Log File Location

* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jellyfin Desktop\logs`
* Linux: `~/.local/share/jellyfin-desktop/logs/`
* Linux (Flatpak): `~/.var/app/org.jellyfin.JellyfinDesktop/data/jellyfin-desktop/logs/`
* macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Jellyfin Desktop/`

## Config File Location

The main configuration file is called `jellyfin-desktop.conf`. You can also add a `mpv.conf` to configure MPV directly.

* Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Jellyfin Desktop\`
* Linux: `~/.local/share/jellyfin-desktop/`
* Linux (Flatpak): `~/.var/app/org.jellyfin.JellyfinDesktop/data/jellyfin-desktop/`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Jellyfin Desktop/`

## Web Debugger

To get browser devtools, use remote debugging.

* Run the application with the command argument `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
* Open Chromium or Google Chrome.
* Navigate to `chrome://inspect/#devices`.
* You can now access the developer tools.

If you have problems:

* Make sure "Discover Network Targets" is checked.
* Make sure `localhost:9222` is in the list under "Configure...".
* Make sure `--remote-debugging-port=9222` is specified correctly.

## License

Jellyfin Desktop is licensed under GPL v2. See the `LICENSE` file.
Licenses of dependencies are summarized under `resources/misc/licenses.txt`.
This file can also be printed at runtime when using the `--licenses` option.

## Known Issues

If you build MPV from source, you currently need to disable pipewire or else the client will segfault.
