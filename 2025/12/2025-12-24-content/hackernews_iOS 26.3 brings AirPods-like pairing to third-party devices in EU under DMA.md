# iOS 26.3 Brings AirPods-Like Pairing to Third-Party Devices in EU Under DMA

Monday December 22, 2025 3:20 pm PST by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)

The European Commission today praised the interoperability changes that Apple is introducing in iOS 26.3, once again crediting the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with bringing "new opportunities" to European users and developers.

![iOS 26](https://images.macrumors.com/t/yhvXefawwRAhQDktpUWYQjx3MLI=/400x0/article-new/2025/12/iOS-26.3-Feature.jpg?lossy)
The Digital Markets Act requires Apple to provide third-party accessories with the same capabilities and access to device features that Apple's own products get. In iOS 26.3, EU wearable device makers can now test proximity pairing and improved notifications.

Here are the new capabilities that Apple is adding:

* **Proximity pairing** - Devices like earbuds will be able to pair with an iOS device in an AirPods-like way by bringing the accessory close to an [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) or [iPad](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/) to initiate a simple, one-tap pairing process. Pairing third-party devices will no longer require multiple steps.
* **Notifications** - Third-party accessories like smart watches will be able to receive notifications from the ‌iPhone‌. Users will be able to view and react to incoming notifications, which is functionality normally limited to the Apple Watch. Notifications can only be forwarded to one connected device at a time, and turning on notifications for a third-party device disables notifications to an Apple Watch.

The European Commission says that developers can test third-party TVs, smart watches, and headphones with the new features in iOS 26.3, with the functionality to be "fully available in Europe" in 2026.

iOS 26.3 offers "another step towards a more inter-connected digital ecosystem to the benefit of all EU citizens," according to the European Commission. iOS 26.3 is expected to launch at the end of January.

The changes to proximity pairing and notifications are only available for device makers and ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users in the European Union.

Apple hasn't updated the Apple TV 4K since 2022, and 2025 was supposed to be the year that we got a refresh. There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new Apple TV before the end of 2025, but it looks like that's not going to happen now.

Apple is significantly increasing its reliance on Samsung for iPhone memory as component prices surge, according to The Korea Economic Daily.
Apple is said to be expanding the share of iPhone memory it sources from Samsung due to rapidly rising memory prices. The shift is expected to result in Samsung supplying roughly 60% to 70% of the low-power DRAM used in the iPhone 17, compared with a...

I truly don't understand those that are against the DMA, and all I can imagine is its because they see their devices as “pure” or some crap and don't want others to have a choice.

Even if it's from a security perspective, great. Don't use other headphones or smart watches, but to me, even if I may only use an Apple Watch or AirPods, is such a nice step in the right direction, because it's going to be great for those that do need it (see what I did there? It's almost like something can benefit others that doesn't benefit me! Wild!). In addition, it puts other accessories on equal footing and will make Apple work harder from competition (where I CAN benefit)

Wish all this would hit the US too, bug sigh…

> Some of the DMA changes are good and some not so much.

Yeah, I've been happy with maybe 80% of their rules. For a few, I tend to agree with Apple that the changes could introduce security issues. I love having USB-C for everything now.

Apple put the USB-C in the processor because they knew it was coming.
I remember reading an interview with someone at Apple several years ago, that person claimed that Apple could not innovate if they were forced to use USB-C. It would simply ruin them as a company, because everything hinged on their proprietary connector ?.
