# Texas App Store Age Verification Law Blocked by Federal Judge

Tuesday December 23, 2025 12:36 pm PST by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)

A Texas federal judge today blocked an [App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/) age verification law that was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, which means Apple may not have to support the changes after all.

![iOS App Store General Feature Desaturated](https://images.macrumors.com/t/T5SjvgLdchGm5DEKzIfFVPQgFIQ=/400x0/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg?lossy)
The Texas ‌App Store‌ Accountability Act (SB2420) requires Apple and other app marketplaces to confirm user age when a person creates an Apple Account. Apple Accounts for users under 18 would need to join a Family Sharing group, with new controls available for parents and restrictions for minors.

In a preliminary injunction that delays the implementation of the act, Judge Robert Pitman said that it violates the First Amendment and is "more likely than not unconstitutional."

> The Act is akin to a law that would require every bookstore to verify the age of every customer at the door and, for minors, require parental consent before the child or teen could enter and again when they try to purchase a book. As set out below, the Court finds a likelihood that, when considered on the merits, SB 2420 violates the First Amendment.

The injunction was in response to a motion filed by the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), a group that includes Apple and Google. Today's decision is a win for Apple, as Apple has been fighting against age assurance requirements in Texas and other states. Apple says that the Texas law impacts user privacy.

> While we share the goal of strengthening kids' online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores.

The court will move on to determining whether the law is facially invalid, which would mean that it is unconstitutional and will be entirely thrown out.

Apple hasn't updated the Apple TV 4K since 2022, and 2025 was supposed to be the year that we got a refresh. There were rumors suggesting Apple would release the new Apple TV before the end of 2025, but it looks like that's not going to happen now.

Apple is significantly increasing its reliance on Samsung for iPhone memory as component prices surge, according to The Korea Economic Daily.
Apple is said to be expanding the share of iPhone memory it sources from Samsung due to rapidly rising memory prices. The shift is expected to result in Samsung supplying roughly 60% to 70% of the low-power DRAM used in the iPhone 17, compared with a...

How about take responsibility for your kid and your own actions, instead of the gov ? Parents responsibility do matter still. Something goes wrong you will blame the gov instead of yourself as a parent

Why is it everyone else’s job to parent other people’s children? Whats wrong with people parenting their own child? Parents are such trash these days that they can’t simply take the smartphone away from their child. It’s not like the child actually needs a smartphone anyway.

> As a parent this is a great law! Kudos to Texas for passing this and its unfortunate the federal government is holding it up. By enforcing age on the app store level (or device, when I setup my device for my child), I can ensure my child will only get approved experiences.

You can already do this by setting up a child account in your iOS family. It allows you to set time limits for different apps/games, add age restrictions on the apps your kids can download etc. read the manual. It’s all there.

Overall though, I’m not really in support of forcing Apple to verify age. As they said, it’d require them to log a bunch of identifiable information etc (though I suppose one could argue that it doesn’t have to be a permanent log, just verify age and delete the data) but anyway, as others have said it should be on parents to monitor their kids activities online etc.

> How about take responsibility for your kid and your own actions, instead of the gov ? Parents responsibility do matter still. Something goes wrong you will blame the gov instead of yourself as a parent

They find it inconvenient to follow Apple’s guidelines to protect their kids so they delegate it to the nanny state.

Yes and maybe how about parents taking on the primary responsibility for the actions of their underaged children, as opposed to shifting that responsibility to third parties?
