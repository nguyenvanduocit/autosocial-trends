What is a henge?

A 'henge' is when the sun sets perfectly in line with your street, creating a dramatic view — like [Manhattanhenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattanhenge) in New York.

You can find out more information by clicking the "**How Do Henges Work?**" tab.

Use this tool to find when the next henge will happen for your street.

What makes a good street for a henge?

*(Tips for finding the best henge view)*

* **Pick a long, straight road with a clear view of the horizon.**
  Henges work best when you can actually see the sun touch the horizon. Curvy streets won't align well, and wider streets tend to give better views.
* **Aim for a mostly east–west street.**
  The sun won't set along a north–south road. It doesn't have to be perfect — the sunset shifts a little each day.
* **Avoid entering an intersection address if possible.**
  It's not necessary for this to work, but it will be faster.

We've estimated your street's direction from map data. **If the arrow aligns with your street, you're all set!** If not, drag the arrow handle to match the street direction you want the henge for.

Let's go!

## See How the Sun Moves Down The Street

The Sun doesn’t set in the same place every day. Its position along the horizon shifts as the seasons change.

Most evenings, that angle doesn’t match the direction of a street. But on just a few days each year (if the street is angled correctly), the Sun’s path lines up perfectly—creating a “henge.”

**Compare below to see the sun's path on a henge and non-henge date:**

## Earth's Orbital Motion and Axial Tilt

Earth doesn’t spin upright. It’s tilted on an axis of ~23.5˚. That tilt is what makes the seasons, and it’s also what makes henges possible.

As the tilted Earth circles the Sun, the angle of the sunset shifts across the horizon. A street keeps the same direction year-round, but the Sun only lines up on specific dates. Here, a road running along the equator lines up with the Sun at the equinox.
