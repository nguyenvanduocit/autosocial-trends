<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=107">ABC</a><dd>This notation language was originally designed for transcribing Irish folk tunes, but has since evolved into a considerably richer language allowing, for example, polymetric output on multiple staves.  This music notation format has the advantage of being extremely concise and fairly readable.
<p>
<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=134">AC Toolbox</a><dd>The AC Toolbox is a Macintosh PPC application to assist the algorithmic composition of music. A legacy version for older, 68K-based computers is also available.  Several models for defining musical events are included. They can be used by defining objects such as sections, shapes, masks, or note structures. It is also possible to play, plot, modify, and examine objects in a number of ways. Extensive online help is available.  In addition to Midi input and output, the AC Toolbox can also produce text files suitable for use as data in other programs. In particular, score files for Csound, note list files for Common Lisp Music, and tables for MAX can be produced.   An important method of creating data in the Toolbox is the use of generators. A number of generators have been included reflecting various approaches to the creation of musical material including tendency masks, stochastic functions, chaotic systems, transition tables, recursive subdivisions, metric indispensabilities, morphological mutations, etc.  The AC Toolbox is implemented in Lisp and input syntax often reflects the conventions of this language. It is also possible for a user to extend the Toolbox by adding Lisp functions. For example, additional generators can be defined in Lisp to use with the Toolbox.

<p>
<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=43">AML - Algorithmic Music Language</a><dd>AML consisted of an interpreter and a compiler.   The compiler was written in and used a lobotomized version of the Digital Research MAC assembler.  The compiler generated code that was read by the interpreter. The AML interpreter was written in Intel 8080 assembly language. The interpreter created up to 8 virtual machines that drove analog synthesizers using various D/A and A/D hardware.  Each virtual machine consisted of a stack oriented computer that processed code specifically designed for generating music.  The instruction set consisted various operators for manipulating the stacks, reading note lists, computing note lists in real-time and drawing pseudo random numbers including fractals.  A version supporting MIDI was the final development, and this version ran on an Apple 2 computer equipped with an Intel 8080 board which talked to a Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface.  A  wide range of students and composers in the LA area used this system,  many through the UCLA extension program.  LA Composer Jeff Rona wrote several works for AML, and it was first demonstrated in Denton TX with his "Step Music" with dancers Sean Green and Dianna McNeil.  There is an article in the ICMC proceedings for the Denton conference.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=73">CLM (Common Lisp Music)</a><dd>Common Lisp Music (CLM) is a sound synthesis package in the Music V family written primarily in Common Lisp.  The instrument design language is a subset of Lisp, extended with a large number of generators: oscil, env, table-lookup, and so on.  The run-time portion of an instrument can be compiled into C or Lisp code. Since CLM instruments are lisp functions, a CLM note list is just a lisp expression that happens to call those functions.  Recent additions to CLM include support for real-time interactions and integration with the Snd sound editor.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=77">CYBIL</a><dd>CYBIL is a compositional language for the efficient specification of arbitrarily complex Csound scores. It is integrated into CECILIA and can be used to generate scores for any kind of Csound orchestra.  The syntax of CYBIL owes to Leland Smith's SCORE language and, to an extent, to Heinrich Taub's Common-Music. Scores are specified as parameter lines with the help of a number of data generators such as sequences, masks, lines and exponentials. These generators can be further modified by the use of functions such as random, urns and constrained random and parameters cross-referencing.

The Foo Kernel layer is implemented in Objective-C and is made accessible to Scheme through a set of types and primitives added to the Elk Scheme interpreter. The Foo Control layer is implemented in Scheme and OOPS, an object-oriented extension to Scheme. Whereas the Foo Kernel layer implements the generic sound synthesis and processing modules as well as a patch description and execution language, the Foo Control layer offers a symbolic interface to the kernel and implements musically salient control abstractions. The user interacts with the Foo environment by writing Scheme programs which eventually will define and execute synthesis patches in non-real-time.

Composers use a simple API to create melodies, harmonies and counterpoint, from the simplest single-voice piano song all the way up to a symphony.  Code is compiled into both MIDI and sheet music in PNG and PDF format, which can be downloaded or displayed directly through the browser.  The output can therefore be easily synthesized or performed by instrumentalists.  The language "knows" basic harmony and counterpoint, and can take care of much of the calculation necessary in programming if the composer chooses.  Themes or melodies can be pulled out into functions and shared among composers, thus allowing them to collaborate in the same way that programmers do.  Since the songs are stored on the MusicDNA servers, you can also edit your compositions from anywhere.  The site also allows you to store MP3s, MIDIs,  sheet music or other media, so that you may give out the URL to your creations.

While drawing benefit from the huge amount of knowledge and experience gathered around the PatchWork software, OpenMusic implements a set of radically new features that make it a second generation compositional software. Based on Digitool Macintosh Common Lisp, OpenMusic provides a visual programming interface to Lisp programming as well as to CLOS (Common Lisp Object System). Thus OpenMusic is an Object Oriented (OO) environment. Objects are symbolized by icons that may be dragged and dropped all around. Most  operations are then performed by dragging an icon from a particular place and dropping it to an other place.  These places include the OpenMusic Workspace as well as the Macintosh finder itself. A lot of classes implementing musical data / behaviour are provided. They are associated with graphical editors and may be  extended by the user to meet specifical needs. Different representation of a musical process are handled among  which common notation, midi piano-roll, sound signal. High level in-time organisation of the music material is proposed through the " maquette " concept.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=138">Q</a><dd>Q is a modern functional programming language based on the term rewriting calculus. Programs are simply collections of equations which are used to evaluate expressions in a symbolic fashion. Q offers an elaborate interface to Grame's MidiShare, and also has a basic audio interface. The latter will be improved over time (additional modules for doing modular synth and dsp stuff are in the planning stage). The MidiShare interface already makes Q a nice environment for (realtime) MIDI programming.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=94">Realtime Composition Library for MAX</a><dd>This library - a collection of patches for MAX (an interactive graphical programming environment for multimedia, music, and MIDI) - offers the possibility to experiment with a number of compositional techniques, such as serial procedures, permutations and controlled randomness. Most of these objects are geared towards straightforward processing of data. By using these specialized objects together in a patch, programming becomes much more clear and easy. Many functions that are often useful in algorithmic composition are provided with this library - therefore the composer could concentrate rather on the composition than the programming aspects.  The Real Time Composition Library (RTC-lib) was developed during my extensive work on Lexikon-Sonate (1992 ff.), an interactive realtime composition for computer-controlled MIDI-piano. Regardless the fact that it was conceived for a concrete project it became more and more obvious that its functionalities are open and generic enough to be used by other composers in different compositional contexts. Although - from the theoretical point of view - based on paradigms which have been extracted from serial thinking - and its further developments until nowadays it does not force towards a certain aesthetic, but provides a programming environment for testing and developing musical strategies. Please note that "serial" has here another connotation than it normally has (especially in the US): "serial" here refers to a certain way of musical thinking rather then dodecaphonic techniques, which have been abandoned by the serial theory itself (cf. Gottfried Michael Koenig and Karlheinz Stockhausen).

It follows a Music-N paradigm, but has a number of novel extensions, most notably the ability to  define new unit generators within the language.   In MPEG-4, SAOL is used to  transmit synthesis descriptions controllable with MIDI or by a new lightweight score format called SASL, and to transmit effects-processing algorithms which  apply to natural (waveform-encoded) audio within the MPEG-4 audio scene.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=110">Silence</a><dd>Silence is an extensible system for making music on computers by means of software alone. It implements Music Modeling Language (MML), which represents music as a directed acyclic graph of nodes that can be notes, groups of notes, transformations of notes, or processes generating notes. MML is to sounds as VRML is to pictures. Silence currently uses its own Java interface to Csound as a synthesis engine.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=152">SOUL (SOUnd Language)</a><dd>SOUL is a language for audio development focused on portability and speed, but also on accessibility for audio enthusiasts and professionals. Conceived as "an audio equivalent of OpenGLSL or OpenCL", its goal is to produce audio programs than can run not only on the CPU but also on heterogeneous or remote hardware, without an impact on the complexity for the developer. Claiming that the CPU is not the best place to run these programs, the authors are confident that domain-specific hardware will be the future of sound programming, and accessible and portable tools to exploit these will be necessary. Like graphic shaders, SOUL programs run within another "host" application, that can be written with any language or framework without bearing on its performance. SOUL is currently in beta.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=85">SoundModel (CCPL)</a><dd>Common Composer's Programming Language (CCPL) is a computer programming environment aiming at composers and researchers in the field of electroacoustic music.  SoundModel is part of CCPL,  does not depend on any particular synthesis method, and can be interfaced to many different methods as long as the parameters of the method are closely related to the acoustical result. The language can be used to describe a large universe of sonic-structures with complex dynamic behaviour and complicated interdependencies which makes it useful in a computer music environment.

<dt><a href="showlist.cgi?oneid=143">SuperCollider Server</a><dd>A successor to SuperCollider 2 for Macintosh OS9. Synthesis takes place in a separate process (the server), controlled by OSC messages generated by a client. Any software that can produce OSC messages can be used to control the client, however. The library of sound-processing functions is now implemented as C++ plugins to the server, allowing users to write their own using the server API.   SC Server includes a client whose language is similar to SC 2, but is extended with some borrowing from functional programming notation. It features powerful data manipulation classes and multi-threading for algorithmic composition. GUI, MIDI in/out, HID (joystick/other) input, Wacom tablet input are also supported. Optimized for real-time, live-performance scenarios.
