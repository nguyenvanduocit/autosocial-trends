**Why this matters:**  Municipalities across the US are quietly adopting surveillance technologies in rapidly growing numbers with over 80,000 cameras already out on the streets. These systems track residents' movements, collect biometric data, and build massive databases of our daily lives.

alpr.watch scans meeting agendas for keywords like "flock," "license plate reader," "alpr," and more. Each pin on the map shows where these conversations are happening so that you can make a difference.

## Understanding Mass Surveillance

### What is ALPR?

**Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** systems use cameras and artificial intelligence to capture, read, and store license plate data from every passing vehicle.

These systems work 24/7 creating a massive database of where vehicles, and by extension, people, travel. Every trip to the grocery store, doctor's office, or place of worship gets recorded and stored.

### What is Flock Safety?

**Flock Safety** is one of the largest manufacturers of ALPR cameras in the United States, marketing their systems to neighborhoods and law enforcement.

Flock cameras capture license plates, vehicle make/model, color, and other identifying features. This data is shared across a massive network of agencies and jurisdictions, creating a surveillance web that tracks millions of Americans.

### The Slippery Slope

History shows that surveillance systems expand beyond their original scope:

* Systems marketed for "solving crimes" get used for immigration enforcement
* Temporary programs become permanent infrastructure
* Data sharing agreements grow to include more agencies
* Technology advances enable new invasive uses
* Regulations and oversight consistently lag behind deployment
