# Mozilla’s next chapter: Building the world’s most trusted software company

[Anthony Enzor-DeMeo](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/author/anthony-enzor-demeo/ "Posts by Anthony Enzor-DeMeo")

Today, I step into the role of CEO of [Mozilla Corporation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/). It is a privilege to lead an organization with a long history of standing up for people and building technology that puts them first. The internet is changing fast, and so are the expectations people bring to the products they use every day. Mozilla has a critical role to play at this moment.

I want to thank Laura Chambers for her exceptional leadership. As interim CEO, Laura led Mozilla through a defining moment in the web’s history — navigating AI’s arrival, a major antitrust case, double-digit mobile growth in Firefox, and the early success of our revenue diversification strategy. She brought clarity, stability, and focus to the organization, and I’m grateful for her leadership through this transition and am glad she’ll continue to be part of Mozilla, returning to her role on the Mozilla board of directors.

When I joined Mozilla, it was clear that trust was going to become the defining issue in technology and the browser would be where this battle would play out. AI was already reshaping how people search, shop, and make decisions in ways that were hard to see and even harder to understand. I saw how easily people could lose their footing in experiences that feel personal but operate in ways that are anything but clear. And I knew this would become a defining issue, especially in the browser, where so many decisions about privacy, data, and transparency now originate.

People want software that is fast, modern, but also honest about what it does. They want to understand what’s happening and to have real choices.

Mozilla and Firefox can be that choice.

Few companies share our strengths. People trust our brand. Firefox brings us global reach. Our teams know how to build reliable, independent software at scale, and our business model puts the user first.

As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.

* First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.
* Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.
* Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.

We will measure our progress against a [double bottom line](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf). Our work must advance our mission and succeed in the market. In the next three years, that means investing in AI that reflects the Mozilla Manifesto. It means diversifying revenue beyond search.

Success means Firefox grows across generations. Mozilla builds new revenue engines. Our principles become a differentiator.

We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths.

If we stay focused, Mozilla will grow in relevance and resilience. Firefox will reach new audiences. Our portfolio will strengthen our independence. Our approach to building trusted software will set a high standard for the industry.

Mozilla is ready for this moment. I am excited for the work ahead and grateful for the trust placed in me.
