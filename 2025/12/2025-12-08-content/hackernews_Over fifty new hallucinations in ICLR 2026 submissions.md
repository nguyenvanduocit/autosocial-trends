# GPTZero finds over 50 new hallucinations in ICLR 2026 submissions

GPTZero used our Hallucination Check tool to find 50+ hallucinations under review at ICLR, each of which were missed by 3-5 peer reviewers.

International Conference on Learning Representations is among the world's most prestigious machine learning research conferences.

### Table of contents

Peer review is under siege. By speeding up the writing process, LLMs and other AI tools are overwhelming scholarly journals and conferences and the peer review pipeline with hallucinated papers ("AI slop").

These aren’t just issues for low-ranking journals with high acceptance rates. The GPTZero team used our [Hallucination Check tool](https://gptzero.me/sources) to scan 300 papers under review by the prestigious International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). **We discovered that 50 submissions included at least one obvious hallucitation,** which were not previously reported.

Worryingly, each of these submissions has already been reviewed by 3-5 peer experts, most of whom missed the fake citation(s). This failure suggests that some of these papers might have been accepted by ICLR without any intervention. Some had average ratings of 8/10, meaning they would [almost certainly have been published](https://papercopilot.com/statistics/iclr-statistics/iclr-2025-statistics/).

Is there a specific report or published article you think we should check?

### Here's 50 confirmed hallucitations in ICLR 2026 submissions

In the [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WIf6EGQXN9TMCeH7d18GWC4H14Sb9h5NBKTB_3vawD8/) below, we’ve included a specific human-verified hallucitation our tool flagged in each paper. According to the [ICLR’s editorial policy](https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/11/19/iclr-2026-response-to-llm-generated-papers-and-reviews/#:~:text=Papers%20that%20make,includes%20such%20issues.%C2%A0), even a single, clear hallucitation is an ethics violation that could lead to the paper’s rejection. Given that we've only scanned 300 out of 20,000 submissions, we estimate that we will find 100s of hallucinated papers in the coming days.

### Under Siege

Scientific journals and academic conferences are being crushed by an avalanche of submissions fueled by generative AI, paper mills, and publication pressure. Between 2016 and 2024, the number of scientific articles published annually [jumped 48%](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/13/quality-of-scientific-papers-questioned-as-academics-overwhelmed-by-the-millions-published), while [retractions](https://retractionwatch.com) and [other scandals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435624003056) proliferated. Many scientific conferences and journals are struggling to find qualified peer reviewers, while reviewers are “[overwhelmed](https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/5/4/823/124269/The-strain-on-scientific-publishing)” by the increasing demand placed on their time.

Academic conferences like ICLR are also under pressure. ICLR is one of the most important annual gatherings of artificial intelligence researchers on the planet, yet many recent conference submissions and peer reviews [show signs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03506-6) of AI authorship. These signs run the spectrum from verbosity and excessive bullet points to fake data and “hallucitations.”

### What Hallucination Check Surfaced

Since GPTZero launched our Hallucination Check tool to catch hallucitations in January, we’ve tested it on RFK Jr.’s [“MAHA” report](https://gptzero.me/news/making-america-hallucinate-again-gptzero-detects-new-errors-in-major-government-report/), a scandal-ridden [Deloitte Australia report](https://gptzero.me/news/deloitte-australia-citation-check/), and hundreds of other documents. This week we used it to scan a sample set of 300 ICLR papers submitted to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Conference#tab-active-submissions). Our tool flagged 90 papers as containing at least one citation that appeared to not exist online. Following human verification, we determined that 50 papers included at least one actual hallucitation.

### Defining Hallucitations

Given the high stakes for both researchers and editors, Hallucination Check is engineered to prioritize accuracy, provide transparency into the evaluation of each source, and err on the side of caution. It uses our AI agent, trained in-house, to flag any citations in a document that can’t be found online. These flagged citations are not automatically hallucinations — many archival documents or unpublished works can’t be matched to an online source — but they indicate which sources require further human scrutiny. Like [ICLR](https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/11/19/iclr-2026-response-to-llm-generated-papers-and-reviews/#:~:text=We%20have%20been%20relying,evidence%20as%20identified%20above.), GPTZero recommends that a human determine if a flawed citation is an AI-generated fake or the result of a more conventional error. Although the line can be blurry, we define hallucitations as citations resulting from the use of generative AI that seem to paraphrase or combine the titles, authors, and/or metadata from one or more real sources. We don’t consider a flawed citation to be a hallucitation if it can’t plausibly be found online,\* or if the title and authors clearly match a real source (even if the rest of the citation is wildly inaccurate).

The following table shows the difference between a real citation, a flawed citation, and a hallucitation according to our methodology. The differences are highlighted in red.

Like GPTZero’s AI Detector, Hallucination Check has an extremely low false negative rate, so we catch 99 out of 100 flawed citations. Because our tool will flag any citation that can't be verified online, the false positive rate is higher.

### The Future of Peer Review

Peer review is an essential part of scholarly publication, yet the current system leaves reviewers and editors outnumbered and outgunned. GPTZero’s Hallucination Check provides two critical benefits to the peer review pipeline. First, using Hallucination Check together with GPTZero’s AI Detector allows users to check for AI-generated text and suspicious citations at the same time, and even use one result to verify the other. Second, Hallucination Check greatly reduces the time and labor necessary to verify a document’s sources by identifying flawed citations for a human to review. We hope that identifying these 50 hallucitations in 50 ICLR submissions shows the value of Hallucination Check for those facing the submissions avalanche.

Our goal is to make the peer review process faster, fairer, and more transparent for everyone involved. *Try GPTZero's* [*Hallucination check*](https://gptzero.me/sources) *for yourself, or* [*reach out to GPTZero's team*](https://gptzero.me/sales)*.*
