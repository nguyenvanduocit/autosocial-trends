## Why Fighter Jets Ban 90% of C++ Features

### Video Metadata

- **Runtime:** PT33M50S

### Description
A single unhandled exception destroyed a $500 million rocket in seconds.

The F-35 wasn't going to make the same mistake.

By carefully slicing C++, engineers created one of the strictest coding standards ever written.

This...is Programming Like a Fighter Pilot.

In this video, we dive into the history of software in aircraft, the (thousands!) of programming languages the Pentagon had to deal with, and perhaps the wildest of all, the JSF (F-35) C++ standard.
