### All algorithms implemented in Python - for education 📚

Implementations are for learning purposes only. They may be less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library. Use them at your discretion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

📋 Read through our [Contribution Guidelines](/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.

## 🌐 Community Channels

We are on [Discord](https://the-algorithms.com/discord) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community)! Community channels are a great way for you to ask questions and get help. Please join us!

## 📜 List of Algorithms

See our [directory](/TheAlgorithms/Python/blob/master/DIRECTORY.md) for easier navigation and a better overview of the project.
