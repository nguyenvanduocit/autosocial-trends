Capitalism’s dominance may have run its course. A new system of control has taken its place, one Yanis Varoufakis calls technofeudalism. For Varoufakis, former Minister of Finance for Greece and number-one bestselling author, the elite few who run Big Tech exercise the same level of influence that feudal overlords once did. Except now, they not only threaten democracy but wish to rewrite the rules of global power themselves. Join Varoufakis as he reveals why we need to thwart these new figures, and why we need to get Musk and Sam Altman out of the White House before it is too late.
