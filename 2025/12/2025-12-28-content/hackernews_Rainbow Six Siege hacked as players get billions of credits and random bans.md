# Rainbow Six Siege Hacked as Players Get Billions of Credits and Random Bans

[Dimas Ibnu](https://www.shanethegamer.com/author/diman/)28/12/2025

[eSports News](https://www.shanethegamer.com/esports-news/ "View all posts in eSports News")[0 Comments](https://www.shanethegamer.com/esports-news/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-global-server-outage/#respond) 2[5 min read](https://www.shanethegamer.com/esports-news/rainbow-six-siege-hacked-global-server-outage/)

**Rainbow Six Siege** is currently facing a major crisis, with mounting evidence pointing to a large scale hack or exploit, even as Ubisoft continues to describe the situation as a server incident. The disruption has now escalated into full service outages across all platforms, [according to Ubisoft’s own service status page.](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status)

Players across PC and console are being urged by the community to stay offline, as reports continue to surface of accounts receiving billions of in game credits, rare and developer only skins, and experiencing random bans.

> Players are reporting massive amounts of R6 Credits, Renown, Alpha Packs, and exclusive items unexpectedly.

## Ubisoft Confirms Widespread Outages Across All Platforms

The official service status page for **Rainbow Six Siege** now shows critical issues across every major platform.

On PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, core services including authentication, in game store access, and matchmaking are all listed as being in outage, while overall connectivity is marked as degraded. Ubisoft states that issues are being investigated, but has not provided a timeline for recovery.

The scale of the outages has further fuelled claims that this is far more serious than routine server instability.

## Ubisoft’s Statement Draws Heavy Criticism

Earlier, the official Rainbow Six account acknowledged that it was aware of an incident affecting the game and said teams were working on a resolution. No mention was made of a security breach, hack, or exploit.

> We’re aware of an incident currently affecting Rainbow Six Siege. Our teams are working on a resolution.
>
> We will share further updates once available.

That wording has been met with heavy backlash from players, many of whom believe Ubisoft is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation. Community responses have accused the publisher of calling it a server issue while core systems appear compromised.

Some players also questioned why the game remained online for hours while accounts were being altered in real time.

## Players Report Billions of Credits, Dev Skins, and Ban Chaos

As the incident unfolded, players reported logging in to find their accounts flooded with billions of R6 Credits and Renown, thousands of Alpha Packs, and access to exclusive cosmetics such as developer skins and Glaciers.

> Why is nobody talking about what is happening on Siege right now? Everyone that logs in gets 2 Billion R6 credits, Renown, Developer Skins and Glaciers 😭 [pic.twitter.com/9SBiLdrirm](https://t.co/9SBiLdrirm)

There were also widespread claims that the in game ban feed had been taken over, displaying arbitrary messages. Thousands of accounts were reportedly banned and unbanned at random, including those belonging to streamers and high profile players.

Prominent Siege creator **KingGeorge** described the situation as completely broken, warning players not to log in and strongly advising against spending any currency, as it could lead to bans or rollbacks once Ubisoft regains control.

> Btw as a side note I would not login right now, definitely don’t spend any credits or renown could lead to a ban.

## Community Expects Rollbacks, Fears Punishment

With authentication and account systems affected, many players now expect Ubisoft to roll accounts back to a previous state. However, fears remain that innocent players could still face penalties, especially those who unknowingly spent credits thinking the issue was a visual glitch.

Others argue that banning a significant portion of the active player base would be disastrous, adding further pressure on Ubisoft to handle the aftermath carefully.

The lack of clear communication has only intensified frustration, with players demanding transparency about what actually happened.

## What Players Should Do Right Now

Until Ubisoft confirms the issue is fully resolved and explains the cause, players are strongly advised to stay offline, avoid logging in, and do not spend any credits or Renown if access is restored.

With Rainbow Six Siege’s core services offline worldwide and player accounts potentially compromised, this incident could have lasting implications for the game if not handled properly. Ubisoft is expected to provide further updates as its investigation continues.
