# Status of the US Dollar as Global Reserve Currency: USD Share Drops to Lowest since 1994

## by Wolf Richter • Dec 26, 2025 • [78 Comments](https://wolfstreet.com/2025/12/26/status-of-the-us-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency-usd-share-drops-to-lowest-since-1994/#comments)

## **Central Banks diversify their holdings into dozens of smaller “non-traditional reserve currencies.”**

#### By [Wolf Richter](https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/) for [WOLF STREET](https://wolfstreet.com/).

The share of USD-denominated assets held by other central banks dropped to 56.9% of total foreign exchange reserves in Q3, the lowest since 1994, from 57.1% in Q2 and 58.5% in Q1, according to the IMF’s new data on Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves.

USD-denominated foreign exchange reserves include US Treasury securities, US mortgage-backed securities (MBS), US agency securities, US corporate bonds, and other USD-denominated assets held by central banks other than the Fed.

Excluded are any central bank’s assets denominated in its own currency, such as the Fed’s Treasury securities or the ECB’s euro-denominated securities.

![](https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Global-Reserve-Currencies-12-25-2025-USD-share-quarterly.png)

It’s not that foreign central banks dumped US-dollar-denominated assets, such as Treasury securities. They did not. They added a little to their holdings. But they added more assets denominated in other currencies, particularly a gaggle of smaller currencies whose combined share has surged, while central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets haven’t changed much for a decade, and so the percentage share of those USD assets continued to decline.

As the dollar’s share declines toward the 50% line, the dollar would still be by far the largest reserve currency, as all other currencies *combined* would weigh as much as the dollar. But it does have consequences.

### **Why is having the top reserve currency important for the US?**

Foreign central banks buying USD-denominated assets, such as Treasury securities, helps push up prices and push down yields of those assets. Being the dominant reserve currency had the effect of helping the US borrow more cheaply to fund its huge twin deficits – the trade deficit and the budget deficit – and thereby has enabled the US to run those huge twin deficits for decades. At some point, this continued decline as a reserve currency, as it reduces demand for USD debt, would make the trade deficit and the budget deficit more difficult to sustain.

The dollar’s share had already been below 50% before, in 1990 and 1991, after a long plunge from the peak in 1977 (share of 85.5%). This plunge accompanied a deep crisis in the US with sky-high inflation and interest rates, and four recessions over those years, including the nasty double-dip recession. Central banks lost confidence in the Fed’s willingness or ability to do what it takes to get this inflation under control that had washed over the US in three ever larger waves.

The dotted line in the chart below indicates the 50%-share. The dollar’s share bottomed out at 46% in 1991, by which time the Fed had brought inflation under control, and soon, central banks began loading up on dollar-assets.

Then came the euro, which turned into the next set-back for the dollar, but not nearly as much as European politicians had promised when pushing the euro through the system; they were talking about parity with the dollar. That talk ended with the Euro Debt Crisis that began in 2009.

Then, over the past 10 years, came dozens of smaller “non-traditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them.

The chart shows the dollar’s share at the end of each year, except 2025 where it shows the share in Q3:

![](https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Global-Reserve-Currencies-12-25-2025-USD-share-long.png)

### **But they didn’t actually dump USD-denominated securities.**

Foreign central banks increased their holdings of USD-denominated assets by a hair in Q3 to $7.4 trillion, the third increase in a row.

Since mid-2014, despite some sharp ups and downs, their holdings of USD-assets have remained essentially flat.

So, what has caused the percentage share of USD assets to decline over the years is the growth of foreign exchange reserves denominated in other currencies, particularly many smaller currencies, as central banks have been diversifying their growing pile of foreign exchange assets.

The chart below shows foreign central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets – US Treasury securities, US MBS, US agency securities, US corporate bonds, etc. – in trillions of dollars:

![](https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Global-Reserve-Currencies-12-25-2025-USD-level.png)

### **The top foreign exchange reserves by currency.**

Central banks’ holdings of foreign exchange reserves in all currencies, and expressed in USD, rose to $13.0 trillion in Q3.

Top holdings, expressed in USD:

1. USD assets: $7.41 trillion
2. Euro assets (EUR): $2.65 trillion
3. Yen assets (YEN): $0.76 trillion
4. British pound assets (GBP): $0.58 trillion
5. Canadian dollar assets (CAD): $0.35 trillion
6. Australian dollar assets (AUD): $0.27 trillion
7. Chinese renminbi (RMB) assets: $0.25 trillion

The euro’s share, #2, has been around 20% since 2015. Before the Euro Debt Crisis, it was on an upward trajectory and had already risen to nearly 25%.

The rest of the reserve currencies are the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart (more in a moment). Combined, they have gained share over the years, at the expense of the dollar, while the euro’s share has remained roughly stable since 2015.

![](https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Global-Reserve-Currencies-12-25-2025-all.png)

### **The rise of the “non-traditional” reserve currencies**.

The chart below takes a magnifying glass to the colorful spaghetti at the bottom of the chart above.

The soaring red line shows the combined surge of assets denominated in dozens of smaller “nontraditional reserve currencies,” as the IMF calls them. Combined, they reached a share of 5.6%, just below the yen-denominated assets (5.8%).

But the share of the RMB (yellow) has been declining since Q1 2022, and its share is now back where it had been in 2019, amid ongoing capital controls, convertibility issues, and a slew of other issues.

In other words, the USD and the RMB both have given up share to the “non-traditional reserve currencies” as other central banks have been diversifying away from assets denominated in USD and RMB.

     Would not bet on this trend to continue forever. Once word spreads on stablecoins and on how to purchase those dollars in shitty 3rd world countries using only your mobile, escaping the local depreciating currencies, the dollar will probably even strengthen in relative terms.

       You’re getting things confused. “Foreign exchange reserves” — the topic of this article — are holdings exclusively by central banks and are not related to what people do with their local currencies and how they exchange them in everyday life.

         IMHO – it’s surprising that this measure was lower in 1993-1994. I would have thought this measure was lowest since WWII.

         MS,

         It’s not surprising to me because I lived through the mid-1970s through the 1980s in college and grad school with various jobs along the way, and then starting my career. And I remember what it was like: sky-high inflation, sky-high interest rates, tens of thousands of banks and S&Ls collapsed, big repeated waves of unemployment topping out at over 10% and staying over 7% for many years. It was very hard to find a job. These were tough times for someone to start out in. The US was in a crisis. It eventually got fixed or fixed itself, and the 1990s were much better.

     I am focused on the Wolf paragraph

     They added a little to their holdings. But they added more assets denominated in other currencies, particularly a gaggle of smaller currencies whose combined share has surged, while central banks’ holdings of USD-denominated assets haven’t changed much for a decade, and so the percentage share of those USD assets continued to decline.

     The underlying currency of the world’s commerce, that rapacious beast that manifests itself in full view of denial is the Uncle Sam based dollar system.

   When other countries ran trade surplus with us they reinvested their extra USD here making the USA the world piggy back. Our US exceptionalism was the result of easy access to capital to take risk. Those trends may all be changing with current changes under way. Our military will always give us an edge in receiving capital but that may also be changing. For instance, Germany is getting self sufficient and will probably buy less US dollar denominated instruments. Tis the season for change ; Nikkei 225, peaked on December 29, 1989, hitting an all-time intraday high of around 38,957.44. It took until Feb 22 2024 to regain that high.

     Well there is that rather than the obvious solution which is the public option access to medicare level insurance. Perhaps a scale that charges more if you are one of the fortunate few wealthy rather than our current work horse the working family.

   DXY is in a trading range since July 1st low @96.4. When trillions of foreign promises actually pour in the dollar will rise. If SPX turns down DXY will rise. The dollar might fall only if we lose a major war.

     I agree with you, DXY 50DMA is 99.13 above its 200 DMA of 99.06. Everything is interconnected and it’s all setting up for the perfect storm. If DXY gets above 102 it’s a good time to diversify 105 would be an overshoot of the 104 target. I like the traditional commodity currency, Canada kiwi and Australia, Norway. When or if the DXY reaches those levels I would be a buyer of commodities currency or their short term bonds. The USD or DXY looks like a safe place to be and of course the Yen, but the yen has implied risk if central banks other than Japan make a coordinated action to prevent the Yen from appreciating as a PUT to global risk selling. Our Inflation should rise and unemployment should fall. Government Puts will be sly. If the $2000 stimuli check get issued in 26 will 9 million defaulted student loan people make a 2k payment? Probably not. :) but they should!

     One must never neglect the very old regularity, the Santa Claus rally.

     Personally, given the nose bleed valuations for risky assets, for me the correct strategy is T bill and chill.

     I can’t calculate a scenario in which the current monetary conditions don’t end up in a roaring inflation episode

     Asset prices are the avatar of inflation created by the excess issuance of the controlling commercial currency. It is not hard to find mathematical evidence that the increase in asset prices leads the increase in rental cost for that asset by six months or more. The increase in cost continues past the peak in asset prices which decline unable to sustain the price of hope previously assumed but have reevaluated and currently embrace the improbable, that the magic is codified within the most powerful human emotion. Even though the simplest love love love more love

     1. The euro didn’t exist before 1999. The long-term chart (chart #2) goes back to 1965.

     2. The US dollar is still the reference currency, and so all global things, when expressed in a common currency, are expressed in US dollars. So you can get the GDP of Japan in YEN and in USD, but not in EUR. Get used to it.

   Hello Wolf, thank you for producing this series on reserve currencies. I was wondering if you had any more detail on the specific currencies within “non-traditional reserve currencies?”

   Anecdotally, I have heard that the Qatari Riyal has begun to play a significant role across West Asia and East Africa in terms of exchange, though I do not know if that would have any bearing on what currencies central governments keep in their reserves.

     The IMF does not disclose detailed data on the dozens of currencies in the “non-traditional” category. The Chinese RMB was part of that basket until the IMF pulled it out in 2016 and gave it its own category that we can see now.

     Note that the share of these dozens of currencies combined is 5.6%, so each currency alone has a minuscule share, but all combined, they account for 5.6%. If you add the RMB back into this group, the percentage rises to 7.6%. So as a group, it would be #3, but spread over dozens of countries.

     The non-traditional currencies group was composed in part by the currencies of other OECD countries, according to an IMF article in 2022 (it didn’t give per-currency share and details either).

     So looking at the OECD countries whose currencies are not broken out separately here, that would be the European countries that are not part of the Eurozone (Czechia, Denmark, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Poland, Sweden), Mexico, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Turkey, Israel, South Korea, and New Zealand.

     The other part of the currencies was often based on trade relationships and currency pegs. Here is a quote from the article:

     *“For example, Namibia holds a large share of its reserves in South African rand due to its peg to that currency and trade relations with South Africa. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic hold Russian rubles due to their close trade relationships with Russia.”*

       Thank you for the explanation. I do wish the IMF would provide more detail on the smaller currencies. The quote you pulled out at the end is suggestive, and I am tempted to use it to spin a narrative about the rise of bilateral trade settlement in local currencies at the expense of USD.

       Either way, it will be interesting to see whether these trends hold through the latter half of the decade.

         1. Bilateral trade agreements have existed long before the big ones were negotiated. Neighboring countries always had trade agreements. But trade agreements are about tariffs and various customers regulations, not currencies. Trade agreements don’t dictate currencies. Companies that trade with each other can use whatever currencies they agree to use. And they have always traded in their local currencies, nothing to do with the USD.

         2. The USD has never been used in trade between Namibia and South Africa. Or really anywhere in Africa. They use regional currencies, such as the West African CFA franc and Central African CFA franc. Or they use local currencies.

         3. What’s relatively new are these huge global trade agreements, but even these huge global trade agreements don’t specify which currency has to be used.

         4. Companies can pay for any purchase with any currency as long as the seller agrees to take it. This is part of the sales contract. If an African mining company sells minerals to a a company in the US, it’s going to gladly get paid in USD. If it sells it to a company in Germany, it’s going to gladly get paid in EUR.

         5. Trading in USD is very different from “reserve currency” and has no impact on the USD. It doesn’t make any difference to the US whether a German company pays in EUR or USD for LNG from Qatar.

         Yes, I’m sure about it. That’s just payments.

         What does make a difference is if German entities sell their USD securities to buy euro securities.

         And what does make a difference is if the German company buys the LNG from Qatar instead of from a US LNG exporter. But the currencies used to pay for the LNG make no difference for the US.

         Correct. The biggest letter in BRICS is the C, China, and the RMB’s share has been skidding for years, see last chart. The R, ruble, is a trash currency, and no one wants to hold assets denominated in it; it has collapsed against the USD. The I, Indian rupee, is down 50% over the past decade against the USD, steady as she goes.

       Reserve currencies are a subset of reserve assets…though nowadays with Bitcoin and Gold so liquid they are becoming quasi-currencies. Drug and Weapons cartels are major enterprises who routinely settle transactions using these quasi-currencies.

   Initial hypothesis on rise of “non-traditional” reserve currencies…

   Historically (pretty darn historically) the USD was a decent bastion of stability/store of value when compared to the vast majority of currencies around the world (whose issuing governments were not particularly shy about running the old currency printin’ press when their fiscal/trade balance management “policies” failed – a not uncommon event.)

   But those days are long gone for the US, with its own deranged fiscal/trade imbalances and no honest fixes remotely in sight. Enter USD quantitative easing/money printin’.

   So if you are a saver/international trade participant these days you are much more equally likely to get diluted/screwed by the USD as your own/bilateral trade currencies – so why go to the trouble/cost of interposing the USD in there?

   Result – less reason to hold the USD around the world.

     Agree with that. It’s not that the U.S. is really any worse than the other big currencies, as the central banks of Japan, England and the EU did equally stupid things before and during COVID. So the U.S. may still be the cleanest dirty shirt, but the cleanliness gap between it and the other dirty shirts is less than it used to be.

     The U.S. has shown that it’s not willing to reduce spending, and is not willing to increase taxes. The only way out then is borrowing and inflation.

     Hence, less reason to hold it and more diversification.

   It looks like dollar holdings are just fine……but in reality…..the purchasing power of dollars held by the banks since 2014 have declined by 37%.
   Since the banks want to hold approximately the same percent of total gdp they have added other currencies to make up for the dollar.
   So what looks stable is actually a huge drop in dollar holdings not only as a percent but more importantly how much it buys……which will continue as long as the deficits do…….good luck with that.

      A modest proposal: For starters, every federal agency (including military) gets 5% less, but unlike with DOGE, cuts are not micromanaged from the top for political reasons, and agencies must figure out how to accomplish their missions with less. Next, taxpayers all pay 5% more than they are presently paying. Net recipients of transfer payments (welfare etc.) take a 5% haircut. We keep the tariffs except some of the more punitive levels. We let Wolf figure out what they should be. All of this is done without malice. We all need to do with less.

        I agree we need to survive with less and for most not a hardship,perhaps exempt those whom it would be,but,do not feel even that is nearly enough if we are serious about paying the debts owed,guess anything though as a start would help as it is figured out.

      “Managed recession” is the solution. The Fed should regulate credit creation to keep annual GDP growth in the 1% range for a five year period. That would slowly squeeze out many zombie corporations through five years of a steady rate of bankruptcies.

    Being the world’s reserve currency was initially a huge boon for the US. It was one of the primary reasons why the post WWII period of the 1950’s and part of the 60’s was such a sweet spot in our economic history.

    However, as we know, being the reserve currency of the world is much like doing drugs. The addiction tears at the body and soul of the country. As other countries step up to compete, America has gotten hooked on running annual $2T deficits that the rest of the world has been paying for.

    No major country in their right mind would want to repeat the reserve currency mistakes of Bretton Woods. The world will end up with a basket of currencies and gold as the new reserve asset for all. This will be fairer and have less downside.

    Unfortunately for the US, this will mean we will have to live within our means.

      I think you have the chicken and egg backwards. The 1950s and 1960s success was due to the U.S. having a virtual monopoly on manufacturing, as Europe was left destroyed by WW2 and the current manufacturing powerhouses of South and East Asia were not developed yet.

      It was those factors that led to the U.S. dollar being adopted as the reserve currency. In other words, the USD as the world reserve currency was the symptom, not the cause, of our post-war success.

        Thanks for your comment, you are right.

        These were both the reason for such enormous economic advantage. And in reality the reserve currency annointment wouldn’t have occured without the circumstances at the end of WWII.

        However, as you know, there was an alternate plan put forth by Keynes called the Bancor which was the basket of currencies and gold. While a better long term plan (for the world in my opinion), it would have struggled to work properly in the first couple decades after WWII because of all the weak economies.

        In many ways, the US reserve dollar just had to happen after WWII, at least for a period of time. I think what we are seeing now is that it isn’t working for a number of other accomplished nations and certainly has fostered in the US a dependency on debt to run the country.

        The shifting and sharing of world power is a story as old as time.

          Bretton Woods was replaced by currency float and FOREX which allows the free market to set currency exchange rates. Gold is less than 1% of global assets and is not a currency of any sort.

        Where do you people get this storyline from? American Monopoly on what? Europe had a big problem with food and resources in the beginning, but their factories were back to work the moment bombs stopped falling. Unwinding the mess of the German railyards took a little while, but they were producing consumer goods in no time. England was a bankrupt but that didn’t keep them from manufacturing their own products. They were even the first country to successfully put a jet airliner in the skies…albeit with the typical built-in problems that always surface in that endeavor. Japan’s steel industry was intact and rapidly undermined American products…our cutlery factories began shifting offshore and were totally wrecked in less than two decades. We lost practically every basic industry needed for daily work and survival in exchange for a bunch of electronic games. And China did us in because of our own foolish lawyer-led politico traitors who can’t figure out what underlies an actual base for all the other bloated crap. We won’t even go into all the people who got a lift up aquiring our used but still functional products…not that any of that helped our factories to produce any more to export anything…all because we throw shit out before we need to ensuring that the whole damn country goes deeper into debt which is always transferred to the national black hole. Now, please show us this giant mountain of American made products that were sold brand new to foreign countries under our so-called “Monopoly”, and then open up all of those domestic landfills and look at the volumes of imported junk that’s in them.

        Get your head out of the sand Beach Dude. I’m no gold bug. I won’t be around when the future folks need it to do all their space cadet junk, so I can’t say what it should be valued at now. But we wouldn’t be communicating here without metals, period. A shovel is real. Gold extracted and refined is real. Both can be used to build an economy, basic or advanced. All your valuations of dirt, stick shacks, phoney promises to pay, and contracts yet to be fulfilled amount to little more than the weight of air and a rushing wind to carry a fire. If this pile of nothing comes tumbling down there will still be someone who will pay gold to someone else to operate that damn shovel to grow food on the dirt field where your abandoned skyscrapers once stood. Get it? The electricity seizes up and no more finished metals can be had. Suddenly those ounces and tools become something and all of your fake economy is gone. No oil. No gas. No turbines. No jets. No computers. Wooosh. And no Wolf to tell you it’s all gonna work out. Remember that other guy who spread false hope? “Ooh, look out.

    Canadian dollar as a percentage of foreign currency reserve went up a bit from 2020 to 2023, and looks like it went down a bit this year.

    The CAD to USD went up by a cent last week, not bad lol

    And gold premiums are high in Canada: people are paying at least C$7500 for a legit ounce of gold and C$160 for an ounce of silver. And a fractional piece of gold is like buying it for C$10,000 an ounce. Tulip mania.

    And Canada has weak laws against crime and self defence that jewellery stores are helpless when mobs of juvenile thieves storm the glass displays with hammers in order to loot the gold.

    And there’s scandals of counterfeit gold being packaged as if it was from the Canadian mint. I’ll keep my “worthless fiat” for now.

      2. This article is about “foreign exchange CURRENCIES” that central banks hold.

      3. Gold does not figure into any of these numbers since it’s not a a currency and not a foreign exchange asset.

      4. Gold is a “reserve asset,” and so you might want to see the share of gold as a percent of total “reserve assets.” But that’s a separate topic and has zero business being here.

    Wolf, seeing the decline of central banks purchasing U.S. debt, is this along with the U.S. Treasury (prior) QT, leading to why the 10 yr treasury refuses to break below 4%; keeping 30 yr mortgage rates 6%+; hence locking up trillions in home equity, which ripples through the economy and GDP?

    “Rather, it has been accompanied by a rise in the share of what we have called nontraditional reserve currencies, including the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, South Korean won, Singaporean dollar, and the Nordic currencies.”

      In know, gold bugs care about that. But it doesn’t have any impact on anything. If a central bank buys gold, someone else has to sell it. Gold just changes hands. And the guy who sold it has to do something with those dollars, such as buy Treasury securities…

      But all the hype about gold — even here in the comments — drives up the price of gold. It’s hype-driven, and I’m not going to participate in that hype.

      And I would also have to list all the big central banks that have NOT been adding any gold at all for years, including the Fed, the ECB, the BOJ, the BOE, the BOC, and many others.

        Firstly, thank for you the article. However as the subject of gold has entered the conversation – earlier you described the Dollar as a reference currency. Yet the Dollar floats. The whole subject was a ‘subject’ surrounding the Jamaica Accord in ’76 and was (purposely) not defined.

        Add Triffin’s Paradox.

        The absence of a real value peg prohibits price discovery (and leads to hot money flows that fail to produce real returns).

        Bretton Woods failed in 1958. The London Gold Fix was an effort to prop it up and it was disbanded in ’68. The logical consequences were subject to math. What has gone on since ’71 has been one form of fraud after another.

        Call me crazy – but I think we may be moving to a Bancor style clearing unit that will be backed by gold, particularly when you look at things like Project Aurum from the BIS – the world is actively looking for an off ramp from the Dollar (and we should be too).
