Here's an example of the advert

It's just horrible for your sister. I'm sorry.

You could try complaining to the advertising standards authority <https://www.asa.org.uk/about-asa-and-cap.html>

It really sounds like, given your sister's condition, it might be best to disable the smart features on her fridge

[–][Diplomatic\_Gunboats](https://old.reddit.com/user/Diplomatic_Gunboats) 421 points422 points423 points 3 days ago\* (2 children)

Short version, yes its legal. The only way it wouldnt be 'legal' is if she had opted out/turned off adverts on her fridge and they were still being sent through.

Its unlikely (I've seen those ads) the ad itself would fall foul of any ASA regs, they are not age/content restricted, but the ASA does include 'appropriate placement' in its assessments and if I raised a complaint I would argue having an ad that is designed around personal messaging to someone inappropriately (In the context of the show at one point she's getting messages from a politician through her TV) is contextually inappropriate if they then deliver that ad through something like a fridge. Its deliberately blurring the line between fiction and reality. The issue of course is that the people broadcasting the Ad are responsible, not the show itself (if its a placement rather than content issue). Which would be who-ever made the fridge.

Its an incredibly unfortunate coincidence but your next steps are going to have to be a)disabling ads on the fridge, b)notifying the docs immediately that there may not be an issue with her at all (if they adjusted her meds stronger on the basis they think they were not working because of fridge messages - this could have adverse effects if they are working just fine) and c)raise an ASA complaint if you feel like it. The ASA will review every complaint it receives.

Yes. It’s legal. But your poor sister I can only imagine how scary it was for her :( as someone with a family member who suffers the same, get her a basic fridge with no screens or internet on. It’s too much, life is a lot more peaceful without being bombarded with adverts on your bloody fridge anyway.

This is a crap situation and an unbelievably unfortunate coincidence but I’d be very surprised if there’s anything illegal going on here.

At the end of the day the major issue here is that your sister has schizophrenia and the advert was unexpected. If she’s this fragile then whoever is responsible for her care needs to ensure that she isn’t being exposed to potentially frightening or triggering media, and that means understanding what is in her home.

I can't see how there's any wrongdoing here. If it's a smart device, it's probably linked to some sort of account and most of these have advertising baked into their T&C's. I've Googled the ad and, if it's the one I'm seeing, then it's clear that it's advertising a TV show. It's unfortunate that this has triggered your sister but this ad could have appeared anywhere. I understand appearing on a fridge might have been distressing but, if anything, I think the issue here is being more about cautious of the kind of technology she has in her home. In the meantime, check to see if this feature can be disabled on the fridge.

It’s not illegal to advertise on a fridge, no. Was she not aware that her fridge had a screen and ad capability?

Im confused, she obviously was having an episode. Clearly.

The legally of the advert isnt something we can really say, because you dont provide any context, but it's obviously personalised because she or someone has set it up on her behalf.

This show is Pluribus and it is indeed a weird and sinister show. Carol is the main character. I can totally understand why someone vulnerable to mental health issues would be thrown by this. I’d complain to ASA due to the location of the ad and its messaging. As advertising becomes more personalised and present in more places, advertisers need to understand how it impacts vulnerable people and how to behave more responsibly.

I haven't seen the ad or the show, but if it just happens for op's sister and the main character to share a name, is this the fault of a personalised ad?
In an ideal world, personalised ads could potentially prevent this by now showing ads that could trigger an episode in someone.

She believed that her fridge was communicating with her because it used her name. This led her to, incorrectly, believe she was having a psychotic episode. She told doctors at the hospital that her fridge was trying to communicate with her.

This resulted in 2 days in hospital and medications being adjusted.

We're both realising now that there was no psychotic episode. She wasn't hallucinating. Her fridge was genuinely running an advert that used her first name and a very cryptic disturbing message.

I don't think it's personalised. I think it relates to a TV show they are advertising with a main character called "Carol" same name as my sister.

I dunno, I feel like it's because she's mentally ill that she thought that. Like, if I saw my smart fridge saying my name, I wouldn't jump to "my fridge is communicating with me", I would do some research first. The fact that she panicked and sought treatment is understandable and it's good, it was the right thing to do in her situation, but that's because she has a known mental illness. It sucks for her that a normal thing like an advert with a coincidental name on it can cause such a lot of stress but I'm not sure that makes it a situation where wrong has been done; if she were on a bus and got freaked out after she heard somebody whispering her name which later turned out to have been a random stranger chatting on the phone to someone with the same name as her, you wouldn't be saying that random stranger was to blame.
