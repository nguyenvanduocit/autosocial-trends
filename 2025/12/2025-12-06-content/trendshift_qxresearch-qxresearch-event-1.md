* Install the dependencies following these steps :

  + Star this repository (top right corner)
  + <>Code > Download ZIP > Open cmd/terminal in that location
  + Run this command : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  + Replace API keys in `yml` files

\* The setup for different projects might not be the same. Please refer to the individual setup guides given for each project.
