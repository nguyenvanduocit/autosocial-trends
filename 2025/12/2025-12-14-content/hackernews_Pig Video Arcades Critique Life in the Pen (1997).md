Wilbur was so special that his friend Charlotte labored through the night to shape her web into the words: "some pig." Now evidence is surfacing that shows other pigs, possibly all pigs, may be as special as the lovable hero of E. B. White's classic tale. Joystick in snout, Hamlet and Omelette, the two animals that could become their species' poster children, were seen playing videogames earlier this week in a BBC documentary that aired in the United Kingdom.

The animals' skills show that, at least in some respects, pigs could be as smart as chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates, says Stanley Curtis, a professor of animal sciences at Pennsylvania State University. Curtis, who has been doing research on pigs for more than 30 years, helped the pair hone their videogame skills, and is ultimately interested in finding more livable quarters for the farm animals.

So what do livable quarters have to do with videogames? The hope, Curtis says, is that some day pigs may be able to tell humans what they do and don't like in terms of living arrangements. But first, pigs have to be able to communicate with humans. The video experiments are a way to test their cognitive skills, and videogames could eventually provide the animals with symbolic language, Curtis says.

"The first thing we have to do is know more about their thought processes," Curtis says. "So far, in the videogame tasks that we have given them, they have performed remarkably well and quickly."

Hamlet and Omelette aren't playing Doom, Myst, or Quake, yet. But using a joystick they control with their snouts, they have learned to move a cursor and line it up with other items on the screen.

To conduct his studies, Curtis had to build an experimental arcade for pigs. He began by modifying a US$10 joystick he bought at the local Wal-Mart. First he replaced the stick's handle with a plastic stem and capped it with a tractor gear-shift knob so the pigs could easily grab it with their snouts. Then, over a period of six weeks, Curtis worked on getting the pigs interested in the joystick by handing out rewards every time they grabbed the knob with their snouts.

Next, Curtis hooked up the joystick to an IBM PC and a 13-inch monitor that he installed behind a clear plastic screen about 18 inches away from the pigs' faces – a distance that was recommended by a veterinarian optometrist. Teaching the animals to make the connection between the joystick manipulation and the movement of the cursor on the screen turned out to be easier than expected.

"Our colleagues who had done work with primates told us not to worry about this step," Curtis says. "And indeed [Hamlet and Omelette] learned that very quickly."

The final hurdle involved teaching the pigs to line up the cursor with an icon on the screen. Again, Curtis turned to the reward method. He installed a machine that would automatically deliver an m&m every time the pigs performed the routine correctly. It took just a few hours for Hamlet and Omelette to figure out the trick.

Curtis says the pigs learned to play the simple games every bit as quickly as primates. In fact, Hamlet and Omelette exhibited more interest in the task at hand than their primate cousins.

"They weren't just lever-pressing on the joystick," says Bill Hopkins, a professor at Berry College in Rome, Georgia. As a researcher at the Yerkes Primate Center in nearby Atlanta, Hopkins has been doing similar work with chimpanzees and other apes for several years. "They looked like they were catching on that there was more to it," he says. "They looked engaged."

About the only problem so far is one of attention span: About 15 minutes into a videogame session, Hamlet and Omelette usually get tired of playing and lie down. Chimpanzees, on the other hand, play for hours on end.

The pigs are still far from being very accurate, but the work is promising, Hopkins says. "If the animals reliably develop the use of this system, down the road I think some really interesting stuff could be coming out of this."

This summer, Curtis plans to train two other pairs of pigs to play videogames. Taking them through the initial stages faster, Curtis hopes the new pigs will take to videogames with renewed vigor.

In the future, Curtis will focus on more challenging exercises to see if pigs can pick between several characters or icons that represent objects. That would constitute a rudimentary form of symbolic language. With similar techniques, primates have been able to express themselves in "languages" with a vocabulary of up to 500 words.

"I'm not surprised that pigs are pretty bright and capable," says Curtis, who over years of watching the animals became convinced pigs were among the most intelligent farm animals.

"But I was gratified by it," he says. "We think human beings are pretty special. And we believe the nonhuman primates [because of the resemblance to humans] should be rather special, too. When a pig can learn things as quickly as chimpanzees, that's remarkable."

Some pigs.
