GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project.
This page contains the latest release of
GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point
in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space,
denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the
Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF,
and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with
Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.

### Commercial Use

A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial
(non-free) software. The answer is yes. The GNU Font Embedding
Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that. See the next section
for details. The main purpose of the licensing is to require
derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public
under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those
fonts with certain software. Thus, preserving the license terms
in derivative fonts provides a public benefit. The licenses also
provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their
volunteer work.

### Copyright, Derivative Works, and License

Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont
contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various
degrees. Some of those contributions are letter forms of established
alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many
animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger
international protections. See for example this memorandum of
applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where
Unifont was created):
[Unifont Copyright Protections](../210205_Unifoundry_Memorandum.pdf).

Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of
the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception
and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1. These are free licenses.
The remainder of this section provides details.

These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License,
either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception
that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a
violation of the GNU GPL. The full terms of the license are in
 [LICENSE.txt](../LICENSE.txt).

As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under
the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with
the GNU font embedding exception. The SIL OFL is available at
 [OFL-1.1.txt](../OFL-1.1.txt).

**Specialized versions** — built by request:

* **PSF:** A specialized PSF 1 console frame buffer font
  consisting of 512 glyphs for use with APL, *A Programming
  Language,* in console mode (single-user mode on GNU/Linux,
  etc.), mainly to support GNU APL:
  [Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz](/pub/unifont/unifont-17.0.03/font-builds/Unifont-APL8x16-17.0.03.psf.gz)
  (4 kbytes)
* **HEX:** All the Plane 0 glyphs in Roman's .hex format, for those who
  wish to experiment:

* **HEX:** The above .hex file with combining circles added:
  [unifont\_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz](/pub/unifont/unifont-17.0.03/font-builds/unifont_sample-17.0.03.hex.gz) (1 Mbyte)

On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the
uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder.
On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows
folder on your main disk.
On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.

For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from
the menu, then Preferences. A Settings window will appear. Make sure
that you're on the Text tab in that window. Then make sure that the
"Antialias text" box is checked. The OpenType version of the font should
then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger. The font won't look
very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.

**Note:** BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing
information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore
this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially
true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts.
Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software.
The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the
the X Window System standardized on version 2.1.
The PSF 1 version of Unifont *is* a monospace font but is
limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines
that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.

All unifont.hex sources are in the full
[Unifont Utilities](unifont-utilities.html) download page.

### Unifont Limitations

Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point.
This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter
combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel
marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.)
or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word
(Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont.
In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort.
Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should
use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate
forms.

### Drawing New Glyphs

If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at
gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers). Several
contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate
to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.

### Special Note: New Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK Glyphs

The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel
Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane 2 and Plane 3. However,
those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government
of the PRC, *and thus they cannot be used in a free font.*
If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs,
please do not send them for inclusion. Unifont includes many glyphs
in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers.
More are planned for the future.

### Release Notes

This latest release is part of the GNU Project. You can view the
[GNU Project Unifont Page](https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/unifont) on Savannah.

The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the
Unicode Plane 0 range is 65,536 code points
minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points,
minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points,
minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF).
This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points
apart from the Private Use Area.

The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the
higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points
in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.

        * Updated to reflect current Unicode rendering:
          㳽 (U+3CFD), 㸿 (U+3E3F), 䑮 (U+446E), 䒳 (U+44B3), 䕈 (U+4548),

        * Updated as per GB18030-2022 change: 垕 (U+5795).
        * Modified to comply with the GB18030-2022 standard pertaining to
          character composition:
          + 姉 (U+59C9): This character is a phono-semantic character.
            Therefore, the right side should be "市" (U+5E02) instead
            of "巿" (U+5DFF).
          + 濲 (U+6FF2): This character is a variant of "瀔" (U+7014),
            and the "穀" (U+7A40) on the right side of "瀔" (U+7014) is
            a phono-semantic character, and its "semantic" part is "禾"
            (U+79BE), not "木" (U+6728).
          + 膥 (U+81A5): This character is a Cantonese character for "egg".
            Not yet (未) Become (成) Meat (肉) → Egg, so the upper left
            corner should be "未" (U+672A), not "末" (U+672B).

        - **Paul Hardy** contributed
          U+F1C80..U+F1C9C Sitelen Pona Radicals.\*New in Unicode 16.0.0.

#### Unifont 15.1

* **24 February 2024 (Unifont 15.1.05)**

  + **Plane 0:**
    - **Ho-seok Ee** redrew all Hangul glyphs not in the
      Hangul Syllables range, so their style more closely
      resembles the style of the Hangul Syllables range:
      U+1100..U+11FF Hangul Jamo, U+3131..U+318E Hangul
      Compatibility Jamo, U+A960..U+A97C Hangul Jamo Extended-A,
      U+D7B0..U+D7FB Hangul Jamo Extended-B.
    - **Hayden Wong** improved several glyphs in the range
      U+2100..U+214F Letterlike Symbols.
    - **Johnnie Weaver** redrew U+013D LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L
      WITH CARON for better compatibility with other glyphs in
      the Czech and Slovak alphabets.
  + **Planes 2 and 3:** almost 600 new ideographs, including:
    - **Boris Zhang** and **Yzy32767** contributed
      U+20000..U+2001F.
    - **Boris Zhang** and **Yzy32767** contributed
      the entire CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D range,
      U+2B740..U+2B81D.
    - **湖 远星** contributed 335 glyphs across Plane 2
      and Plane 3 with common Cantonese ideographs.
    - Other new idegraphs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I.
  + **Plane F: Paul Hardy** modified the Sitelen Pona script,
    added combining character indicators and adding several new
    glyphs since the last release. This completes the most current
    version of Sitelen Pona.
    encodings
* **29 October 2023 (Unifont 15.1.04)**

  + Default and Japanese versions have larger supersets
    of Plane 2 and Plane 3 glyphs.
  + **Johnnie Weaver** contributed updates for
    U+266D..U+266F and U+26BC.
* **21 October 2023 (Unifont 15.1.03)**

  + **Boris Zhang** and **Yzy32767** contributed
    CJK Unified Ideographs Extension I glyphs
    (U+2EBF0..U+2EE5D).
  + **湖 远星** contributed 14 glyphs to CJK
    Unified Ideographs Extensions B and C
    and updated U+5C81 and U+6708.
* **21 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.02)**

  + **湖 远星:**
    - Adjusted 46 glyphs in the Plane 0 Wen Quan Yi range,
      U+2F00..U+9FFF.
    - Contributed Plane 3 CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G
      glyphs in the range U+30000..U+3017F.
* **12 September 2023 (Unifont 15.1.01)**

  + As mentioned during the year leading up to this release,
    **TrueType fonts are no longer produced by the default build;
    OpenType fonts have taken their place.** This change has been
    driven by the diminishing support for TrueType fonts in the Pango
    font rendering engine. TrueType fonts can still be built from
    the distribution tarball using the command "make truetype" in
    the font directory.
  + |  |  |
    | --- | --- |
    | [![Johab 6/3/1 Hangul Jamo](../hangul/johab631.jpg)](../hangul/hangul-base.html) | **Ho-Seok Ee** proposed **a new Johab encoding for algorithmic Hangul Syllables generation.** The resulting scheme uses 6 variations of initial consonants (choseong), 3 of medial vowels and diphthongs (jungseong), and 1 of final consonants (jongseong). The image on the left is partial output from a new supporting Unifont utility, `unijohab2html`, which gives an overview of how the three components of a Hangul syllable combine with each other and outputs any overlaps for a font designer's analysis. A full discussion of this new Johab 6/3/1 encoding appears on the [Unifont Hangul Syllables Generation](../hangul/hangul-generation.html) web page. **Minseo Lee (이민서)** provided feedback on the glyphs prior to their release. |
  + Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the
    `hangul-base.hex` file that contains the
    Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins
    at code point U+E000. This allows building a Unifont variant
    with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane 0
    Private Use Area (PUA) using the command
    "`make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex`".
    in the font directory. Unifont builds have traditionally
    left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still
    the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.
  + **Johnnie Weaver** modified "IJ" ligature glyphs U+0132 and
    U+0133. He also modified U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S.
  + **Paul Hardy:**
    - Modified U+2CC2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER CROSSED SHEI and
      U+2CC3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER CROSSED SHEI for consistency
      with the redrawn U+03E2 COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER SHEI and
      U+03E3 COPTIC SMALL LETTER SHEI.
    - Redrew Ideographic Description Characters (U+2FF0..U+2FFB)
      for consistency and added new glyphs (U+2FFC..U+2FFF).
      Also added CJK Strokes glyph U+31EF IDEOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION
      CHARACTER SUBTRACTION.
    - Modified star glyphs U+2605, U+2606, and U+2BE8 for
      consistency.
    - Modified several Chinese ideographs and Korean ideographs in
      CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A (U+3400..U+4DBF) per the
      Unicode Standard version 15.1.0.
    - *Wen Quan Yi Glyphs:* Made modifications to Korean
      ideographs in CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A
      (U+3400..U+4DBF) per Unicode 15.1.0 changes.
      Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A U+3B9D, U+454E,
      U+49C8 (from 湖 远星) and U+56B8.
      Modified CJK Unified Ideographs Extension U+809E and U+891D.
    - Modified Alchemical Symbols (U+1F700..U+1F77F) per Unicode
      15.1.0 changes.
    - Added three hexadecimal digit notations to the Plane 0 UCSUR:
      * U+EBE0..U+EBEF:
        Boby Lapointe's "bibi-binary" notation.
      * U+EBF0..U+EBFF:
        Bruce Alan Martin's bit location notation.
      * U+ECF0..U+ECFF:
        Ronald O. Whitaker's triangular notation.
  + Implemented other glyph changes per the Unicode Standard version
    15.1.0.
  + Several other minor changes; see the ChangeLog file in the
    main tarball for details.

#### Earlier Releases

See the Archive link at the top of this page for information on
earlier Unifont releases.

### Unifont Glyph Tables

Unifont font files contain glyphs in several Unicode planes.
The following table provides an overview of this coverage.

| GNU Unifont Font File Plane Coverage | | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Font Filename | Plane 0 | Plane 1 | Plane 2 | Plane 3 | Plane 14 | Plane 15 |
| `unifont-*` | X |  | X1,2 | X1,2 |  |  |
| `unifont_jp-*` | X |  | X1,2 | X1,2 |  |  |
| `unifont_upper-*` |  | X | X3 | X3 | X |  |
| `unifont_csur-*` | X |  |  |  |  | X |
| **Notes:**  1PCF fonts can only include glyphs in Plane 0.  2Only a subset of Plane 2 and Plane 3 CJK glyphs plus the Plane 1 Copyleft glyph (U+1F12F) are included, to stay within the OpenType limit of 65,536 glyphs.  3`unifont_upper` fonts will contain a superset of Chinese Plane 2 and Plane 3 glyphs plus JIS X 0213 glyphs until the OpenType font nears its limit of 65,536 code points. | | | | | | |

#### Plane 14 Glyphs

This table links to the two ranges of 256 assigned code points
in Plane 14 (Tags and Variation Selector Supplement) that appear
in the `unifont_upper` OpenType and TrueType font files.

#### Plane 0 and Plane 15 Private Use Area Glyphs

Finally, this last glyph table shows ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR)
and Under CSUR glyphs that appear in the `unifont_csur` OpenType
and TrueType font files. Not all of the Plane 0 CSUR and UCSUR scripts
have been drawn, but given the esoteric nature of some CSUR and UCSUR scripts
(including the unavailability of glyph samples for many of the more obscure
constructed scripts), the boxes in the table all have a green background color
even if not at 100% coverage.

### Contributing Glyphs

![16 by 16 pixel sample grid](16-by-16-grid.png)

If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort,
you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above
(SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16
pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on
the left.

When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the
inner box. You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image.
Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility
in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as
a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.

Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel
inner box?

A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other
utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.

The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary
Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have
a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a
particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list
in the Current Coverage section below. The more red a range appears
in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.

### Current Coverage

Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs
where a script begins.

The list below shows the scripts that are in the Unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane, with coverage in this release of Unifont.

\*Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian
Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16
pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32
pixel grid in the future.

Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:

Initially I just posted my additions to **Roman Czyborra's** original
unifont.hex file. Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down.
So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue
with my additions.

Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his
Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website,
along with his archive of Unifont's changes:
<http://czyborra.com/unifont>.

### TrueType Font Generation

**Luis Alejandro González Miranda** wrote a cool combination of scripts to
convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to
have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode
Utilities web page on this site for more information). Pixels are drawn
as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes. This works well with
GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment.
I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline
font is much more flexible.

Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest
GNU Unifont versions to TrueType. I've modified his original scripts to
handle Unicode combining characters.

### JIS X 0213 Kanji

#### Jiskan16

Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions,
`unifont_jp`. This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
pixel Jiskan 16 font. The font is available in two files,
corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213. Both files are
in the public domain.

The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the
[Japanese Fonts](../japanese/index.html)
page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura,
HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki,
Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.

For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes
were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points
in Unicode's Plane 0 and Plane 2 for Unifont. The result
provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free
Unicode font.

#### Izumi16

Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain
Izumi16 glyphs. These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16
glyphs.

### Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)

The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from
version 1.1 of **Qianqian Fang's** Unibit font. The Unibit font
began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic
CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic
of China. It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16
glyphs. Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000
more glyphs.

Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution:
*"The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified
Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by
high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005
(public domain)."* Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands
of these characters. Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs
in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.

Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water.
This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of
"font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for
more details:
<http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi>, or in Chinese at
<http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi>.

The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are
taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the
U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana,
and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers
and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:

* U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement
* U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals
* U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters
* U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation
* U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes
* U+3200..U+32FF: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months
* U+3300..U+33FF: CJK Compatibility
* U+3400..U+4DBF: CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A
* U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs
* U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs
* U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters

Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the
Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont. Likewise, I've told him
to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU
Unifont into his Unibit font. In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also
granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1
to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.

### What's Next?

All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could
easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the
Unifont 9.0.01 release. There are no plans to draw Tangut.
A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn.
If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this
effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under
the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the
GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).

With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode
Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have
"\_csur" in their name.
