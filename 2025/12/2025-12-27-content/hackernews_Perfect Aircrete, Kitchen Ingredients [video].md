In this video we learn how to make aircrete (or aerocrete) using a new method that has no need for specialty tools, and only requires grocery store ingredients.

Thanks to Prana-Tech for letting me use his clips of common aircrete methods! He has some great videos on the subject, including how to make a foam generator for only $20.
