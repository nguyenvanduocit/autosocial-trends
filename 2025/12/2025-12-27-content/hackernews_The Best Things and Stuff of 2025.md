# The Best Things and Stuff of 2025

Fogus

2025.12.23

Great things and people that I discovered, learned, read, met, etc.
in 2025. No particular ordering is implied. Not everything is new.

## Great posts | articles | vids read/watched

* *[A
  calculator app? Anyone could make that](https://chadnauseam.com/coding/random/calculator-app)* by Chad Nauseam, esquire
  - *I love the story about how Hans Boehm and friends developed a
  mind-blowing approach called recursive real arithmetic for numbers like
  pi and (sqrt 2). The post details various symptom -> problem
  definition -> alternative solutions -> solution cycles that the
  team met along the way and should be required reading for
  programmers.*
* *[Lost in
  Manboo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVyz17kwIv4)* - *マンガ喫茶マンボ (manga cafe manboo) shows life
  for some folks who live in 24-hour game cafes in Japan. The video is
  dystopic in a way that matches our modern world perfectly.*[1](#fn1)
* *[The Making
  of Deeper in You on the OP-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z7_A_8il_g)* - *Shows an artist’s approach
  to song creation/composition using the OP-1 synthesizer. This is
  hypnotic to watch for someone with zero musical talent like
  myself.*
* *[An
  interview with Jack Rusher](https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/multi-disciplinary-artist-jack-rusher-on-the-need-to-sustain-your-creative-drive-in-the-face-of-technological-change/)* by The Creative Independent - *A
  lovely interview with online friend Jack Rusher discussing the
  thoughtful application of tech in art, flow, and the state of research
  in the modern computing industry.*
* *[Uncredited: Searching
  for Lost Board Game Designers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWteJW-wYas)* by Amabel Holland - *Amabel
  describes her trials and tribulations while trying to find the designers
  of the long-forgotten board game [Duplicate
  Ad-Lib Crossword Cubes](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4791/duplicate-ad-lib-crossword-cubes).*
* *[Brian
  Weissman on his Magic the Gathering history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TldMsMtHvW8)* - *For anyone
  who came of age during the earliest years of Magic, the name Brian
  Weissman is legendary. In this interview he gives countless anecdotes
  about his experiences in those early days.*
* *[Before
  Arcturus: David Lindsay’s Lost Novels](https://wormwoodiana.blogspot.com/2025/08/before-arcturus-david-lindsays-lost.html)* by Mark Valentine -
  *Mark’s research into David Lindsay revealed evidence that he
  submitted at least two earlier novels, Aletheus and The Confessions of
  an Egoist, to the publisher Chatto & Windus in 1902 and 1908. These
  submissions predated his first published masterpiece, [A
  Voyage to Arcturus](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-voyage-to-arcturus-an-illuminated-edition-david-lindsay/76f8dc45a1376ddf?aid=98208&ean=9781948886307&listref=best-things-2025&next=t).*
* *[What Dan Read](https://what-dan-read.com/)* by
  Dan - *An amazing account of a lifetime of reading.*
* *[Two
  Years After Cormac McCarthy’s Death, Rare Access to His Personal Library
  Reveals the Man Behind the Myth](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/two-years-cormac-mccarthys-death-rare-access-to-personal-library-reveals-man-behind-myth-180987150/)* by Richard Grant - *A
  glimpse into Cormac McCarthy’s massive, chaotically organized personal
  library reveals the reclusive author as a polymath with an insatiable
  curiosity. Scholars are currently cataloging the estimated 20,000
  volumes, many of which contain the author’s annotations.*

## Most viewed posts/videos with/by me

While I’ve posted a few technical post on my personal blog, I’ve
taken a lot of time to guest-post on the [Wormwoodania
blog](https://wormwoodiana.blogspot.com/search/label/Fogus) about weird, macabre, and sardonic fiction and other related,
non-technical topics. I hope to continue this trend into next year.
Also, my most assiduous readers will have noticed that I’ve written more
about games. I’ve decided to keep those posts on this blog since my
intent for the site has always been about systems and systems-thinking
and games are a great way to study and model systems.

* *[The
  long season of langdev](https://blog.fogus.me/langdev/long-season.html)* - *Whereby I speculate if programming
  language development is in a lull.*
* *[On

  games of abstract strategy.*

## Favorite technical books discovered (and read)

* **[Mouse, a Language
  for Microcomputers](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com/)** by Peter Grogono - *Mouse is
  basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the
  book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore
  further.*
* **[Notes on
  Distance Dialing](https://explodingthephone.com/hoppdocs/nodd1956.pdf)** (pdf) by AT&T - *Described the
  telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is
  a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex
  system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks
  interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for
  recommendations for books about the process of designing and building
  the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the
  earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!*

## Favorite non-technical books read

The vast majority of my reading this year was fiction, and I
discovered some real gems.[3](#fn3)

* **[The Eye of
  Osiris](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24201)** by R. Austin Freeman - *This is the first book
  that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in
  the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham,
  Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation
  stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up
  the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader
  to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it.
  The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.*
* **[The Mystery
  of Edwin Drood](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/564)** by Charles Dickens - *His final work
  remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it.
  Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the
  ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The
  meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation
  around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from
  other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints,
  accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some
  cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself.
  What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and
  although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the
  “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason
  enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is
  a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The [Chiltern
  Library edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CHQCS/?tag=fogus-20) of the book contains the story and a good bit of the
  lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its
  publication.[4](#fn4)*
* **[The
  Shadow People](https://www.amazon.com/shadow-people-Margaret-St-Clair/dp/B00005XVNT/?tag=fogus-20)** by Margaret St. Clair - *Sadly out of
  print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades
  and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the
  1980s when I learned about it in the [appendix-n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_N) of the
  1st edition Advanced D&D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of
  the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them
  over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test
  of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings
  in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book
  feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is
  unique even today.*
* **[Lolly
  Willowes](https://bookshop.org/p/books/lolly-willowes-warbler-classics-annotated-edition-sylvia-townsend-warner/793f95da3bb968a0?aid=98208&ean=9781959891635&listref=best-things-2025&next=t)** by Sylvia Townsend Warner - *The book started
  as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British
  middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background
  decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about
  only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out
  on her own to the country[5](#fn5) in her middle age does she gain a
  central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is
  where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this
  unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I
  don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not
  expect how the story ends.*
* **[Patience](https://www.fantagraphics.com/collections/daniel-clowes/products/patience)**
  by Daniel Clowes - *A profound graphic novel using time-travel to
  explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through
  time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he
  loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’
  signature psychological complexity.*
* **[Narcissus
  and Goldmund](https://bookshop.org/p/books/narcissus-and-goldmund-hermann-hesse/2249287049aa22fb?aid=98208&ean=9780553275865&listref=best-things-2025&next=t)** by Herman Hesse - *I’ve read most of the
  books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this
  year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his
  passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in
  life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the
  flesh.*
* **[We
  Who Are About To…](https://bookshop.org/p/books/we-who-are-about-to-joanna-russ/a7176b6dc2109f04?aid=98208&ean=9780819567598&listref=best-things-2025&next=t)** by Joanna Russ - *A small group of
  astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that
  rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so
  the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives
  on subverting reader expectations.*
* **[Fifty
  Forgotten Records](https://tartaruspress.com/russell-fifty-forgotten-records.html)** by R.B. Russell - *Another lovely
  entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical
  explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book
  describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal
  connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new
  albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable,
  reflective memoir threaded throughout.*
* **[The
  Way of All Flesh](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-way-of-all-flesh-samuel-butler/b5c2be53f34c9706?aid=98208&ean=9780375752490&listref=best-things-2025&next=t)** by Samuel Butler \*A novel that follows
  4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular
  bildungsromanesque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads
  to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.[6](#fn6)

## Number of books written or published

As I mentioned, I have taken to writing more on non-technical topics,
but I’ve even taken to dabble in fiction this year. I wrote a lot of
fiction when I was (much) younger but all that I wrote from those days
resides at the bottom of a landfill in Baltimore… which is probably for
the best. I doubt that this avenue will result in any publications or
even anything worth reading at all, but I’m having a great time
regardless.

## Number of programming languages designed

I’ve tinkered with a concatenative functional programming language
named Juxt for years, but it’s not something that anyone should ever
use. My thoughts are almost entirely focused exclusively on moving
Clojure into the future, but I take a moment to think in stacks from
time to time.[7](#fn7)

## Favorite musicians / albums discovered

* *[lovesliescrushing](https://lovesliescrushing.bandcamp.com/)*
  - *It’s been quite a while since I’ve discovered any good ambient.
  This duo’s catalog has accompanied many of my 2025 coding
  activities.*
* *[Whistle
  And I’ll Come to You](https://deathandvanillamusic.bandcamp.com/album/whistle-and-ill-come-to-you)* by Death and Vanilla - *An album that
  conjures the atmosphere of folk horror films despite its electronic and
  psychedelic tones. It has a vaguely similar ethereal beauty that drew me
  to Dead Can Dance 100 years ago.*
* *[Closer](https://mariachiaramusic.bandcamp.com/album/closer)*
  by Maria Chiara Argirò - *Her jazz-infused electronic ambient music
  drilled its way into my ear and nested in my brain for months.*

The artist that I listened to the most in 2025 was [Cocteau Twins](https://cocteautwins.com/) – which probably
mirrors a couple of years around when I was 15 or 16.[8](#fn8)

## Favorite show about a misanthrope tasked with saving a humanity that might not be worth saving at all

[Pluribus](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22202452/)

## Favorite films discovered

* **[Weapons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26581740/)** by
  Zach Cregger - *This one was probably my pick for the best new horror
  film released in 2025. Like Cregger’s other horror film [Barbarian](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15791034/),[9](#fn9) Weapons mixed in black humor without
  being ham-handed about it. The highlight of the film was the performance
  by Amy Madigan, who stole every scene that she was in.*
* **[Triangle of
  Sadness](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7322224/)** by Ruben Östlund - *Östlund is truly the master
  of the cringey moment, but his work is not “cringe comedy” as we
  commonly encounter. The cringe tension in his films instead comes from
  the mismatched expectations of the characters and a dogged insistence on
  magnifying the cringe that arises by stretching scenes to their breaking
  point.*

## Favorite podcasts

* **[Quiet Little
  Horrors](https://quietlittlehorrors.com/)** by [Jen
  Meyers](https://jenmyers.net/about/) and [Jessi Chartier](https://jessichartier.com/) -
  *By far my favorite horror-related podcast going right now. The
  cinematic analysis from the hosts is surpassed only by the texture of
  their personal experiences informing their analysis of films. I consider
  myself extremely lucky to have had the chance to sit down with the hosts
  and talk about Roman Polanski’s film, and Roland Topor’s book on which
  it’s based, [The
  Tenant](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-tenant-valancourt-international-roland-topor/b99ff27c8d84505f?aid=98208&ean=9781948405775&listref=best-things-2025&next=t) for their [penultimate
  2025 episode](https://quietlittlehorrors.com/episode-06-14-the-tenant/).*
* **[Beyond Yacht
  Rock 2000](https://open.spotify.com/show/0mYti5kalrRraItbZubwvk)** - *A podcast with a brilliant premise – devise
  a fictional genre of music and then try to find musicians, albums, and
  songs that adhere to that genre.*
* **[Malcom
  Guite](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXat06LvIYIyE2SpV_IuVjA)** - *Tolkien, Arthurian epic poetry, pipe-smoking… I
  wish this guy was my dad.*
* **[Quinn’s
  Ideas](https://www.youtube.com/%40QuinnsIdeas)** - *I enjoy his long-form science fiction analysis,
  which is a YT genre that I typically skip. I’m pleased that the channel
  has so far avoided devolving into the inevitable booktube haul
  morass.*

## Favorite games discovered

Usually tabletop games, but occasionally video games.

* **Jacoby** - *While reading Montague Rhodes James’
  memoir I came across the mention of a card game called Jacoby. After
  searching high and low for months, I finally found the rules in a book
  from 1890 titled The young folk’s cyclopædia of games and sports.[10](#fn10) This long-lost game is a 3-player
  trick-taking game with some very nice tension.*[11](#fn11)
* **[East
  India Companies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/354132/east-india-companies)** designed by Pascal Ribrault - *The best
  tabletop game that I’ve found in 2-3 years. The game is a distilled [18XX](https://blog.fogus.me/games/18XX/intro.html) game with a
  dash of luck thrown in for good measure. It’s a purely stock holding and
  market manipulation game where a little bit of information compounds to
  large advantages if you can leverage it at the right time. I would play
  this 50 more times if I could.*
* **[Far
  Away](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262939/far-away)** designed by Alexander Jerabek - *A science fiction
  cooperative sandbox game for 2-players but that I’ve only ever played
  solo. While I think that the game as designed would be a better 2p
  affair, as a solo game it’s still an interesting world-builder. I enjoy
  the meta-nature of the game that allows the player(s) to not only build
  the world as they explore it, but they are tasked with defining the
  “mechanics” of the world along the way.*

## Favorite programming languages (or related) I hacked on/with on my own time

* *[Joy](https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/joy.html)*
  - *Joy is a mindfrak of a programming language in the concatenative
  functional language family. The core of Joy is beautiful and among the
  foundational programming languages in my opinion.*

## Programming languages used for work-related projects

* [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) - *2025 marks the
  16th year[12](#fn12) as a full-time Clojure
  programmer.*
* [Java](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/amber-spec-experts/2023-December/003959.html)
  - *Working deep in the Clojure compiler means that a portion of my
  2025 work was in Java.*

## Programming languages (and related) that I hope to explore more deeply

* *[Clojerl](https://clojerl.org/)* - *There was
  once a dialect of Clojure targeting Erlang/BEAM so I would like to catch
  up on it to see where it stands.*
* *[Scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle)* -
  *A very lightweight, Clojure-like, skin on top of JavaScript that it
  super simple to include in HTML pages. I would like to produce something
  that uses Scittle to get a feel for its “Clojure-ness.”*

## Favorite papers discovered (and read)

none of particular note.

## Still haven’t read…

I Ching, A Fire upon the Deep, Don Quixote, and **[a
boat-load of sci-fi](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/09/21/the-amazing-colossal-science-fiction-ketchup/)**

## Favorite technical conferences attended

* *[Clojure/conj
  2025](https://www.2025.clojure-conj.org/)* - *The 2025 edition of the Conj was the first organized
  entirely by [Nubank](https://www.nubank.com)’s amazing
  Clojure community-focused team: Magdalena Useglio, Christoph Neumann,
  and Jordan Miller. Unsurprisingly, I think that this was one of the best
  Clojure/conj events ever, and I’ve seen my fair share. I’m perpetually
  humbled to be part of a community of amazingly thoughtful Clojure
  friends.*
* *[Clojure
  South 2025](https://sites.google.com/nubank.com.br/clojure-south)* - *Before that I was fortunate to be in Brazil
  when Clojure South happened. I had such a great time and was impressed
  by how well the conference was run. I met many new Clojure programmers
  and dozens of brilliant Brazilian programmers for the first time. I
  would love to attend the next one if at all possible.*

## Favorite code read

* *[Implementation
  of Hex Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html)* - *Useful functions for game
  developers/designers.*
* *[SmallJS](https://small-js.org/Home/Home.html)* -
  *A little Smalltalk-80 that compiles to JavaScript.*
* *[Zork
  I](https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1)* - *The original Zork source code. I’ve only started
  digging into the [ZIL](https://setsideb.com/learning-zork-implementation-language-by-steve-meretzky/)
  definitions, but I plan to keep digging for months to come.*
* *[Xerox
  Alto](https://computerhistory.org/blog/xerox-alto-source-code/)* - *So far I’ve only scratched the surface of the
  mountains of system code in the archive. The wisdom contained in here is
  likely to take a lifetime to explore.*[13](#fn13)

## Life-changing technology “discovered”

* *LLMs* *are here to stay, so it behooves me to learn to
  navigate this new world. That said…*
* *[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)*
  *… has had a much larger impact on my life in 2025. I’ve only just
  started collecting my notes using the system, but I’ve managed to
  leverage the system to put together a handful of non-technical posts
  (see the section on my posts above) this year and found the system very
  helpful in composing ideas. This is a long-term WiP, but I’ve very
  pleased so far.*[14](#fn14)

## State of plans from 2025

2025 was a particularly productive year for meeting my plans for the
year. Starting early in the year I knew that I needed a better way to
track my tasks. So to start the year I visited a couple of Japanese
stationary stores[15](#fn15) to get some ideas. In 2024 I had
used the Hobonichi Techo[16](#fn16) and while I found it
to be a lovely system, it didn’t quite work for me. First, it wasn’t
clear how or if I was making progress on my tasks without spelunking
into the past pages of the schedule. Second, I take a lot of notes
longhand in cheap composition notebooks and so I found myself jumping
back and forth between those and the Hobonichi. I tried using an insert
into my Techo case for note-taking but I didn’t like the form-factor. I
take big sprawling notes and filled the pages too quickly. So after the
new year I took a minimalist approach with a Japanese calendar
stamp:

![Rubber stamp calendar](images/bts25-stamp-cal.jpg)

Rubber stamp calendar

The image above shows an example, but the problem with it should be
apparent… there’s just not enough room for fidelity. OK, sure it didn’t
work as a real task tracker, but I still use it to keep track of small
bits of detail associated with days of the week like: energy level,
mood, sleep, exercise, etc. It became apparent that I needed something
that solved three problems: 1) track any number of tasks, 2) give me an
idea of my progress at a glance, and 3) be on hand already. My first
pass at this was to draw a 4-week grid on my notebook and scribble tasks
in pencil into the cells. I would then color the grid as I progressed
through tasks. This worked great for about 5 weeks until I went on a
week-long trip without my notebook, killing my solution to #3. Even
before that however I had found that I wanted to make frequent changes
and move things around, defer items, and change the colors, so it became
apparent that I had another problem to solve; 4) allow for easy change.
While I was on my week-long trip I decided to find a solution that
account for all four of my problems, and it turned out that my solution
was the solution to so many other problems… spreadsheets!

My ongoing tasks sheet

Above you’ll see a representational image that gives the basics of
the task tracking. The rows correspond to tasks and the columns to the
months. The white section on the left are the tasks details like
category, name, description, and success criteria. The colored segments
represent the state of the tasks regarding progress. The left-most
colored column is the current month. Each cell is filled in before the
month starts with high-level goals which are amended and modified as I
make progress (or not). The meaning of the colors are:

* Light green: Task completed and success criteria met
* Dark green: Task completed, but its success criteria changed during
  the process
* Light orange: Not started
* Dark orange: In progress (not shown above)
* Red: Incomplete and/or unsuccessful
* Gray: Not applicable. This is for new tasks that are added to the
  tracker, or removed and brought back. All months are back-filled in
  gray.

And that’s the whole system. It’s easy to change and rearrange. It’s
on-hand.[17](#fn17) I can see how I’m doing at a
glance. Can track any number of simultaneous tasks. Perfect.

Enough of this meta-discussion… how did my plans for 2025 go?

* *[Clojure 1.13](https://www.clojure.org/)* -
  *While a 1.13 release didn’t happen, we did release numerous updates
  to 1.12 and made plans for how to fill out the next version.*
* *[core.async
  next](https://github.com/clojure/core.async)* - *We made some interesting changes to core.async to
  leverage JDK 21+ virtual threads, but before that we made changes to
  smooth the path for allowing opt-in use of vthreads. At the moment there
  are some challenges around the way that the JVM tracks vthreads, but I
  feel pretty good that if we can address those then the implementation is
  solid.*
* *[Simplify my blog](https://blog.fogus.me)* -
  *I completely moved away from Wordpress onto a hacked-together
  Markdown/org-mode + pandoc + bash to static pipeline. It’s a piece of
  junk, but so much more lightweight that what I had running for
  years.*
* *[Juxt](https://gist.github.com/fogus/224d658be2a1afaaffe4ac1f25d1fa61)*
  - *Juxt is my exploration in functional concatenative language design
  built on the JVM. It’s not yet clear to me if or when I would ever
  release this into the wild, but the explorations have been great fun and
  I’ve used Juxt as a vehicle for finding relevant books and papers.[18](#fn18) That said, most of my programming
  time is spent maintaining and evolving Clojure, but there are rare
  moments of time that I can spend on Juxt, and I plan to continue to do
  so in 2025. You’ll see some interesting progress in the gist
  link.*

## Plans for 2026

* *More non-technical writing in 2026.* - *I would like to
  continue explorations of fiction and games. That’s not to say that there
  aren’t a few technical posts in me still, but they will not be my
  priority.*
* *Publish the rules for a card game of my own design.* - *I
  have a couple in the pipeline, and feel like one of them could be a
  keeper.*
* *[Clojure 1.13](https://www.clojure.org/)* -
  *Thinking around the 1.13 release is ongoing and we’d like to get it
  out sooner rather than later. Stay tuned.*
* *Create something with my hands* - *I have no idea what
  this might be, but I’ve been putting off artifact creation for waaaaay
  too long.*
* *Read more non-fiction* - *I’m particularly interested in
  biographies and books-on-books.*[19](#fn19)
* *Read an untranslated book* - *Inspired by the [Untranslated Blog](https://theuntranslated.wordpress.com/)… my
  best chance for success is something written in French. Topic
  TBD.*

## 2026 Tech Radar

![My Zettelkasten stack](images/bts25-zettelkasten.jpg)

My Zettelkasten stack

* try: [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com) - *I’ve
  bounced off of numerous note-taking apps in my time, but my older son
  swears by it for annotating PDFs.*
* adopt: [Antinet
  Zettelkasten](https://www.amazon.com/Antinet-Zettelkasten-Knowledge-Prolific-Researcher/dp/B0BPVTBYG7/?tag=fogus-20) - *I used my growing card file to great effect while
  writing a few essays this year.*
* assess: LLMs - *I’m into the 3rd AI hype-cycle in my life (at
  least) and this is not much different than they other two, save for the
  potential market and job disruptions in play. I tried in earnest to make
  AI work for me, with varying degrees of un-success. I’ve had zero
  success leveraging it in my work maintaining and evolving Clojure. For
  problem formation in the face of novelty, LLMs have been more
  frustrating than helpful and the little gains that I’ve found were in
  the very early phases of problem solving requiring a bare minimum of
  experimental code. But even these examples operate wholly in the known
  rather than in the unknown where I’d like to operate instead. Even in
  these early stages the “hand-holding” involved was more frustrating than
  helpful. In my work, the bottleneck is absolutely not the code. While I
  think that the kind of up-front work that I do could inform
  prompt-engineering to some degree, by the time that I get to that point
  the code is often perfunctory. Most of the work that I do is devising
  and investigating new problem framing rather than in interpolation of
  the known (i.e. analogy play). While the latter is important for sure,
  what’s known often acts as a source of tension to help motivate and
  tease out potentially new solutions. And this is a huge problem in the
  very nature of LLMs. That is, they are trained on the products of
  problem solving processes rather then also in the very processes
  themselves. Further, as a Socratic partner, LLMs are incredibly
  frustrating in their inability to move a “discussion” forward. A good
  Socratic partner creates pressure to move toward truth, but LLMs are too
  sycophantic, lack an awareness of useful tension,[20](#fn20)
  cannot often identify contradiction, and lack any ability to adhere to
  the trajectory of a conversation. So far I’m left wanting, but because
  LLMs are likely to never go away then I’ll see if these downsides get
  better in the future.*[21](#fn21)
* hold: [Boox
  Go 10.3 tablet](https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Go-10-3-ePaper/dp/B0D4DFT3W3/?tag=fogus-20) - *I just couldn’t pull the trigger on this and
  suspect that I will not ever.*[22](#fn22)
* stop: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) -
  *I just don’t do enough in this space to justify continuing down this
  road.*

1. The video has similar vibes to Haruki Murakami’s
   excellent book After Dark.[↩︎](#fnref1)
2. I’d love to try and write something about Corvo’s
   obsession with the Catholic hierarchy and the tenuous idea that it was a
   kind of occult architecture. This may be a bridge too far for my ability
   and knowledge.[↩︎](#fnref2)
3. I have some of these books listed at [bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/lists/best-things-2025) if
   you’re interested in grabbing copies.[↩︎](#fnref3)
4. A lot more Droodiana has been written since 1950 of
   course.[↩︎](#fnref4)
5. The “move to the country” theme present in a significant
   number of pre-WWII fiction representing a reclamation of feminine power.
   I would love to find/create a list of books exploring this theme.[↩︎](#fnref5)
6. Interestingly, this was a recommendation from friend [David
   Nolen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-nolen-37b42813/), who also mentioned another book that just barely missed this
   list, [Benito
   Cereno](https://bookshop.org/p/books/melville-s-short-novels-authoritative-texts-contexts-criticism-herman-melville/f3008086921a816b?aid=98208&ean=9780393976410&listref=best-things-2025&next=t) which I think needs another read in the future.\*[↩︎](#fnref6)
7. If you’re interested in exploring an interesting new
   programming language that mixes interesting ideas, then I recommend [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/) that bills itself as a point-free,
   APL-style, array-oriented modern language.[↩︎](#fnref7)
8. I was in a “junk shop” a couple of weeks ago and found
   both Black Sabbath’s *Master of Reality* and the *Complete
   Vatican Recordings* of the works of Alessandro Moreschi… two albums
   that couldn’t be more different. I suspect that one of both of these
   albums will get a lot of play in 2026.[↩︎](#fnref8)
9. I could have also added Cregger’s *Barbarian* to
   the year’s best filmatic discoveries, but I would like another watch to
   really focus in on the depths.[↩︎](#fnref9)
10. I also found a POD copy of the Nichureki, a
    13th-century Japanese book containing the earliest written record of
    Heian Shogi… a topic for another day perhaps.[↩︎](#fnref10)
11. I wrote an essay about Jacoby and its connection to the
    author M.R. James that is due to be published next year in the journal
    *Ghosts and Scholars* #50.[↩︎](#fnref11)
12. This is strictly my work-life time. My total use of
    Clojure has been longer.[↩︎](#fnref12)
13. While the Alto source code is certainly interesting,
    it’s unclear how the repository credits Douglas Engelbart’s NLS vision
    and Intellect Augmentation, if at all.[↩︎](#fnref13)
14. My ultimate dream is to build a giant card-file and
    then build a Jack Kirby-esque relentless idea-collage universe along the
    lines of his “Fourth World” mythos tying together all of the concepts in
    said file… I may need another lifetime for this.[↩︎](#fnref14)
15. Japanese stationary stores and thrift-shops are two of
    my guilty pleasures. Has anyone else noticed that in the States, there
    are more young people shopping in thrift shops than ever before. I would
    love to understand why. Is it a growing prevalence of Tik-Tok
    thrift-haul videos, an appreciation for retro, an economic indicator,
    all, some, or none?[↩︎](#fnref15)
16. I put my best effort into the Techo, but I could never
    fully buy into the very Japanese view of the planner as a life-book.[↩︎](#fnref16)
17. I’m already in Google Sheets all the time anyway, and
    can access it on my phone if needed. Really though, I’d love to see a
    device in the spirit of the TRS-80 model 100 to do this kind of work on
    the go… but I would still probably not get one. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯[↩︎](#fnref17)
18. You can see the *current* [Juxt
    bibtex](https://gist.github.com/fogus/6d716276678b0698c96dd13e040c71eb) on GitHub.[↩︎](#fnref18)
19. I would also love to read the complete work of the
    comic book creator Jack Kirby. There are some lovely omnibus editions of
    his work, but I don’t quite know how I feel about the fact that the
    comics industry is embracing this format. Certainly singles are a joke,
    but omnibuses have turned comics enjoyment from reading into
    weightlifting.[↩︎](#fnref19)
20. The tension problem is also why I’ve found LLMs to be
    terrible at aiding tabletop game design. A prime characteristic of the
    kinds of games that I enjoy is emergent complexity, but if LLMs identify
    complexity at all, they have so far been terrible at deciding which
    complexity is useful. That is, LLMs have no notion of “delicious
    tension” nor how to devise it.[↩︎](#fnref20)
21. A huge problem with LLMs are that they are by their
    very nature dependent on digitized information. While a larger
    proportion of scientific and computing information is available in
    digitized form, there are still whole fields of knowledge left on paper,
    so to speak. First, a large problem with this fact is that only a small
    fraction of total knowledge is available to training LLMs, leaving large
    gaps in the knowledge base exacerbating the problem of decoupled
    confidence and reality. Second, this is problematic because training
    these models on digital-data leads to an amplification of the biases
    inherent in the digitized records. This can be mitigated by the
    search-augmented and human-in-the-loop systems, but these are also
    incomplete sources of validation and even the validation itself has bias
    (e.g. SEO, status quo, liability constraints, etc.) and often reduce the
    traceability of an answer. A second informational downside of LLMs is
    that they take training data at face-value rather than inherent value.
    However, in my programming career I’ve learned a lot more from bad code
    than good code. Likewise, code input to training is heavily biased to
    work at all and the ingestion itself it geared strictly to work to build
    a plausible-continuation model. Good code works as exemplars of clarity,
    layering abstractions, maintainability, and sad-path security, but so
    does bad code. Heavily curated or contrasting training data could
    mitigate this to some degree, but at the moment, a lot of the code
    generated by LLMs is often lacking these fundamental code
    characteristics. This matches my actual observation of code generation,
    but I would imagine that the inability of the ingestion to distinguish
    valid examples from cautionary examples is more general problem. These
    are all technical points and do not take into account the societal
    problems that LLMs present… which are bountiful! These are evolving
    critiques that I’ll refine through more exposure.[↩︎](#fnref21)
22. The Boox is a truly lovely device, but I’ve developed a
    diametric motivation to de-device myself. This was born from my
    perennial obsession with Cyberdecks and “minimalist” writing devices.
    Every so often I’m hit with a driving urge to build such things, but
    then I get turned off by the supporting communities around them,
    especially its gross fetishization of an “aesthetic of productivity”
    where the act of building (and buying of course) these tools supersedes
    and stands-in for their actual use.[↩︎](#fnref22)
