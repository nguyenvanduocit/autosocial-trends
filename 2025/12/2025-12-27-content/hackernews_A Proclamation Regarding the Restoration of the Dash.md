# A Proclamation Regarding the Restoration of the Dash

Posted on Fri 26 December 2025

> **WHEREAS**, the em—dash (—) has long served as the elegant
> scaffolding of the English sentence, providing the necessary breadth
> for parenthetical thought, sudden turns of phrase, and rhythmic pause;
>
> **WHEREAS**, a modern and unfounded prejudice has arisen, wherein the
> presence of the em—dash is viewed with suspicion and cited as the
> “tell—tale sign” of the unthinking machine;
>
> **WHEREAS**, the Large Language Model has merely mimicked a
> sophistication it cannot truly possess, thereby unfairly maligning a
> mark of punctuation that predates the silicon chip by centuries;
>
> **WHEREAS**, the humble hyphen (-) is a utilitarian stitch for
> compound words and line—breaks, yet is increasingly used as a
> cowardly substitute for the bold, expansive stroke of the em—dash;
>
> **WHEREAS**, I refuse to cede the beauty of classical punctuation to
> the algorithms, nor shall I allow my prose to be flattened by the
> fear of looking “artificial”;
>
> **NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, that I reclaim this mark from the
> domain of the bot and return it to the hand of the writer.
>
> **I HEREBY DECREE** that henceforth, within the borders of this blog,
> the hyphen shall be banished from all roles of punctuation and
> pause—to be replaced, in every instance of stylistic flair, by the
> glorious, unrepentant em—dash.

When writing in both LaTeX and Microsoft Word, I routinely use double or
triple dashes to form em—dashes. It pains me to see people jumping to
conclusions when they encounter an em—dash in the wild.

In protest, I wrote [[1]](#footnote-1) a plugin to convert all hyphens in this blog to
em—dashes. Even ones that really should just be hyphens.

Come join the revolution!
