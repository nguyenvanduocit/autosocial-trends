### Key Features

* Multiple chart/panel types:
  + **Heatmap (Historical DOM):** Uses live trades and L2 orderbook to create a time-series heatmap chart. Supports customizable price grouping, different time aggregations, fixed or visible range volume profiles.
  + **Candlestick:** Traditional kline chart supporting both time-based and custom tick-based intervals.
  + **Footprint:** Price grouped and interval aggregated views for trades on top of a candlestick chart. Supports different clustering methods, configurable imbalance and naked-POC studies.
  + **Time & Sales:** Scrollable list of live trades.
  + **DOM (Depth of Market) / Ladder:** Displays current L2 orderbook alongside recent trade volumes on grouped price levels.
  + **Comparison:** Line graph for comparing multiple data sources, normalized by kline `close` prices on a percentage scale
* Real-time sound effects driven by trade streams
* Multi window/monitor support
* Pane linking for quickly switching tickers across multiple panes
* Persistent layouts and customizable themes with editable color palettes

##### Market data is received directly from exchanges' public REST APIs and WebSockets

#

#### Historical Trades on Footprint Charts:

* By default, it captures and plots live trades in real time via WebSocket.
* For Binance tickers, you can optionally backfill the visible time range by enabling trade fetching in the settings:
  + [data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision/): Fast daily bulk downloads (no intraday).
  + REST API (e.g., `/fapi/v1/aggTrades`): Slower, paginated intraday fetching (subject to rate limits).
  + The Binance connector can use either or both methods to retrieve historical data as needed.
* Fetching trades for Bybit/Hyperliquid is not supported, as both lack a suitable REST API. OKX is WIP.
