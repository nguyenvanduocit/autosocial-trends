# IT GETS WORSE: UK House of Lords attempting to ban use of VPNs by anyone under 16

[2025/12/11 12:37:12 GMT](https://alecmuffett.com/article/134925)

This is deranged, [each nation’s boomers and reactionaries attempting to outdo the others](https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/63901/documents/7465):

> **“Action to prohibit the provision of VPN services to children in the United Kingdom**” … the provider of any Relevant VPN Service which is, or is likely to be — (i) offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom; (ii) provided to a significant number of persons. (c) must make provision for the monitoring and effective enforcement of the child VPN prohibition.

VPNs are [a technology which anyone can implement for themselves](https://alecmuffett.com/article/113969). “Regulatory compliance” of them is not feasible, it’d be like banning DIY.

Not to mention it would include The Tor Project.
