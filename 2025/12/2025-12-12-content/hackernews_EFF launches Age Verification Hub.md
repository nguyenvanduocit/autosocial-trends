SAN FRANCISCO—With ill-advised and dangerous age verification laws proliferating across the United States and around the world, creating surveillance and censorship regimes that will be used to harm both youth and adults, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has launched [a new resource hub](https://www.eff.org/age) that will sort through the mess and help people fight back.

To mark the hub's launch, EFF will host a Reddit AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) next week and a free [livestreamed panel discussion](https://www.eff.org/livestream-age) on January 15 highlighting the dangers of these misguided laws.

“These restrictive mandates strike at the foundation of the free and open internet,” said EFF Activist Molly Buckley. “While they are wrapped in the legitimate concern about children's safety, they operate as tools of censorship, used to block people young and old from viewing or sharing information that the government deems ‘harmful’ or ‘offensive.’ They also create surveillance systems that critically undermine online privacy, and chill access to vital online communities and resources. Our new resource hub is a one-stop shop for information that people can use to fight back and redirect lawmakers to things that will actually help young people, like a comprehensive privacy law.”

Half of U.S. states have enacted some sort of online age verification law. At the federal level, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee last week held a hearing on “Legislative Solutions to Protect Children and Teens Online.” While many of the 19 bills on that hearing’s agenda involve age verification, none would truly protect children and teens. Instead, they threaten to make it harder to access content [that can be crucial, even lifesaving, for some kids](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/thousands-young-people-told-us-why-kids-online-safety-act-will-be-harmful-minors).

It’s not just in the U.S.  Effective this week, [a new Australian law](https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/industry-regulation/social-media-age-restrictions) requires social media platforms to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account.

We all want young people to be safe online. However, age verification is not the panacea that regulators and corporations claim it to be; in fact, it could undermine the safety of many.

Age verification laws generally require online services to check, estimate, or verify all users’ ages—often through invasive tools like government ID checks, biometric scans, or other dubious “age estimation” methods—before granting them access to certain online content or services. These methods are often inaccurate and always privacy-invasive, demanding that users hand over sensitive and immutable personal information that links their offline identity to their online activity. Once that valuable data is collected, it can easily be leaked, hacked, or misused.

To truly protect everyone online, including children, EFF advocates for [a comprehensive data privacy law.](https://www.eff.org/privacyfirst)

EFF will host a Reddit AMA on [r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/) from Monday, Dec. 15 at 12 p.m. PT through Wednesday, Dec. 17 at 5 p.m. PT, with EFF attorneys, technologists, and activists answering questions about age verification on all three days.

EFF will host a free [livestream panel discussion](https://www.eff.org/livestream-age) about age verification at 12 p.m. PDT on Thursday, Jan. 15. Panelists will include Cynthia Conti-Cook, Director of Research and Policy at the [Collaborative Research Center for Resilience](https://thecrcr.org/); a representative of [Gen Z for Change](https://genzforchange.org/); EFF Director of Engineering [Alexis Hancock](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/alexis-hancock); and EFF Associate Director of State Affairs [Rindala Alajaji](https://www.eff.org/about/staff/rindala-alajaji). RSVP at <https://www.eff.org/livestream-age>.

It's unfortunately no longer enough to force websites to check your government-issued ID before you can access certain content, because politicians have now discovered that people are using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy and bypass these invasive laws. Their solution? Entirely ban the use of VPNs.
