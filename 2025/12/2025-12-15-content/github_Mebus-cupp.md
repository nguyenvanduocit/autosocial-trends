## About

The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username
and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally
stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is
a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password
through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of
alternate values.

A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters,
making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily
guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, address,
name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

That is why CUPP was born, and it can be used in situations like legal
penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.

## Requirements

You need Python 3 to run CUPP.

## Quick start

```
$ python3 cupp.py -h
```

## Options

Usage: cupp.py [OPTIONS]

```
    -h      this menu

    -i      Interactive questions for user password profiling

    -w      Use this option to profile existing dictionary,
            or WyD.pl output to make some pwnsauce :)

    -l      Download huge wordlists from repository

    -a      Parse default usernames and passwords directly from Alecto DB.
            Project Alecto uses purified databases of Phenoelit and CIRT which where merged and enhanced.

    -v      Version of the program
```

## Configuration

CUPP has configuration file cupp.cfg with instructions.
