# Update Now: iOS 26.2 Fixes 20+ Security Vulnerabilities

Friday December 12, 2025 11:11 am PST by [Juli Clover](https://www.macrumors.com/author/juli-clover/)

Apple today released iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS 26.2, all of which introduce new features, bug fixes, and security improvements. Apple says that the updates address over 20 vulnerabilities, including two bugs that are known to have been actively exploited.

![bug security vulnerability issue fix larry](https://images.macrumors.com/t/SQzBKIavpsxjZF2UfuvKpVmsxiE=/400x0/article-new/2023/05/bug-security-vulnerability-issue-fix-larry.jpg?lossy)
There are a pair of WebKit vulnerabilities that could allow maliciously crafted web content to execute code or cause memory corruption. Apple says that the bugs might have been exploited in an attack against targeted individuals on versions of iOS before [iOS 26](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/).

> Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.
>
> Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to memory corruption. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.

One of the WebKit bugs was fixed with improved memory management, while the other was addressed with improved validation.

There are several other vulnerabilities that were fixed too, across apps and services. An [App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/) bug could allow users to access sensitive payment tokens, processing a malicious image file could lead to memory corruption, photos in the Hidden Album could be viewed without authentication, and passwords could be unintentionally removed when remotely controlling a device with [FaceTime](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/).

Now that these vulnerabilities have been publicized by Apple, even those that were not exploited before might be taken advantage of now. Apple recommends all users update their devices to iOS 26.2, iPadOS 26.2, and macOS Tahoe 26.2 as soon as possible.

> Every OS upgrade regardless of platform does this, or not?

Android is so componentized that individual parts of the OS are patched daily. The OS is updated quarterly just like Apple, but those are feature updates and not security patches. Meanwhile Apple delays releasing security fixes for weeks that are being actively exploited because they are also trying to make a transparency slider for the clock and can't do those two things separately. In the last 24 hours, my Pixel has updated the Phone app, the Google app, Google Drive, Google Translate, Voice Access, Android AICore, Google Messages, Gboard, Pixel Camera, and Google Wallet. And that's a pretty typical day. The security is outstanding on Android because of how they structured their OS and the flexibility it gives them.

And some of the security fixes were included in 18.7.3 too...

But so far 18.7.3 hasn't been released for iPhones that are capable of upgrading to iOS 26, even if they're still on 18.7.2. It's currently only available to devices that can't upgrade to iOS 26.

I hope that's a temporary error and not a deliberate move by Apple to force users to update to iOS 26.

THAT is why I update, not for the features that have been described so many times here.
But that's just me

In other words, if you're still on Sequoia, switch to another browser (Firefox is good). Stop using Safari.

Because, guess what: even though they updated Sequoia today, it does not include fixes for these "actively exploited" vulnerabilities, according to Apple's "security content" notes. Gee, thanks.

edit: I didn't see Safari 26.2 for Sequoia listed in the security content list, so maybe I missed it, but it's now there and lists these fixes, so **please disregard this post.**

“Even with our annoying alerts, you people won’t “upgrade” to our buggy and unattractive iOS/iPadOS/MacOS 26! So we’ve found some security vulnerabilities that will end your life if you don’t “upgrade” right now. So everybody in the pool!”

Jeez, I predicted this a number of times since 26 came out. The same as it ever was. So what’s worse… the security vulnerabilities or the bugs still in 26? ???

EDIT: Apple’s notes read thusly… “Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 26.”

Okay… then where is the 18.7.3 update? The only way to protect ourselves is to go with 26.2? Give me a break.
