The Typeframe PX-88 Portable Computing System

# A stacked deck.

**It's true. The odds are finally in your favor.**
The Typeframe PX-88 is an integrated system that has been perfectly arranged to guarantee a superior outcome for the operator. Leave it to Typeframe to integrate these critical elements into one commanding machine.

The PX-88 delivers all the power and specialized features expected from a professional system - but built around a dedicated, uncompromising user experience. Is it a cyberdeck or a writerdeck? It's whatever you need it to be. The reliable Raspberry Pi 4 B core handles demanding web-based editors and complex tasks with robust performance. The compact size belies the strength within.

A mechanical keyboard provides a superior, tactile input experience - a professional tool unmatched by common consumer electronics. Furthermore, the system is designed for simple construction with minimal required soldering, and maintenance is streamlined - all internal components are easily reached via sliding access panels.

If you have been looking for a portable, professional computer where input quality meets core performance, look at the PX-88.

**Typeframe. Built for your best work, built by you.**
