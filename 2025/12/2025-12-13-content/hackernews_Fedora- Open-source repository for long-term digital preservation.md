# Fedora is the flexible, standards-based, open-source repository software built to support long-term digital preservation.

## Why Choose Fedora?

Fedora is a sustainable open-source repository system underpinning many types of digital libraries and archives. It’s designed to store, manage, and preserve digital content. Fedora is particularly well-suited for institutions such as libraries, universities, research centres, and museums that need to preserve and provide access to their digital collections.

![Flexibility](https://fedorarepository.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Icon_Flexibility.png)

### Flexibility

Fedora can store, preserve and provide access to any type of digital object. Through native support for semantic relationships, you are free to model your content to suit your needs and build out object relationships that are defined entirely by you.

![Standards](https://fedorarepository.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Icon_Standards-1.png)

### Standards Based

Partnered with Fedora’s published API and the adoption of the OCFL standard for persistence, Fedora uses a variety of globally accepted standard web conventions for interacting with the application.

![Community](https://fedorarepository.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Icon_Community.png)

### Global User Community

The Fedora program has been in existence for 20+ years, and our users represent an engaged, supportive and invested global community focused on sustainability and growth.
